The population of the world is approximately 8 billion now, and this will definitely increase to 9 billion by 2050. Most of these people will live in cities. At the moment, 55% of people live in cities. In the future, this will probably go up to 70%, and the number of people in the countryside will decrease to 30%.

1. What will increase? What will decrease?

2. How certain is the writer about the predictions?

Where will we live?
