STUDENT LIFE
Managing your Money

Congratulations! You just received your first student loan. So now it's decision time. How are you going to spend it? On a new phone? Or some cool sneakers? Well, don't! Before you spend a penny of it, make a budget. Compare the amount of your loan with your expenses (rent, transportation, food).

If you don't have enough money for the year, maybe you can borrow more. But if you borrow money from a bank, you pay interest. So, if possible, ask a friend or family member to lend you the money. If they have some extra money, they will probably help you. Or, a lot of students have part-time jobs to earn some money. And if you are a student, you don't pay much in taxes for the money for the job. With this income, try to save some money for later in the year.
