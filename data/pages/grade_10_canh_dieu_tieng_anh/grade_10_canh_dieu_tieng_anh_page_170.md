Unreal Conditionals: The Second Conditional

If Clause (Past Subjunctive) | Main Clause (Would or modals for Present Conditional)
--- | ---
If Mike used a credit card, | he would get a discount for that purchase.
If you saved your income every month, | you wouldn't need to borrow money from your friends.
If you were rich, | would you start your own business?

We use the second conditional to talk about to talk about things in the future that are probably not going to be true or something in the present which is impossible because it's not true.
Use the past subjunctive in the if clause and would / wouldn't to talk about the probable result in the main clause.

With the second conditional, you can start with the if clause or the main clause. If you start with the if clause, use a comma between the clauses:
If Daniel started saving now, he would be able to buy a new laptop next year. = Daniel would be able to buy a new laptop next year if he started saving now.

Modals
In the main clause, you can use modals instead of would for Present Conditional to express the degree of certainty, permission, or recommendation.
If I had enough money, I might buy a bigger house.
That teenager could make his own decision about how to spend that money if his parents gave permission.
If you gave her a chance, she could perform better.

If I were
It is correct and very common to say If I were instead of If I was.
If I were you, I would not spend all my money for random stuff.

Past Continuous
Sometimes, the Past Continuous is also used in if clause.
If she were cooking, I would help her.
