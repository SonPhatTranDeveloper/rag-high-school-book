UNIT 10

Lesson A

Reported Speech – Statements

Direct Speech | Reported Speech
Tony: "I want to drink some coffee." | Tony said (that) he wanted to drink some coffee.
"My cousin is watching TV now," Lan said. | Lan said (that) her cousin was watching TV at that moment.
Nam: "I will work out at the gym tomorrow." | Nam added (that) he would work out at the gym the following day.

Note:
We use reported speech to report someone's thoughts or actions. When the reporting verb is in the past tense, we usually have to make some changes to the pronouns, tenses, and time expressions.
When the reporting verb is in the present tense, there is no change of tense in the reported clause. Other changes may still be necessary.
Tony says (that) he wants to drink some coffee.

Direct Speech | Reported Speech
now | then / at that moment
today | that day
tomorrow | the next day / the following day
yesterday | the previous day / the day before

Lesson C

Reported Speech – Questions

We use reported speech when we tell someone what another person asked. In reported speech for questions, we change the question structure to a statement structure. The subject comes before the verb in the reported speech for questions.

Yes / No Questions (use ask + if / whether + clause)
Direct Speech | Reported Speech
"Do you work out late?" | He asked me if I worked out late.
"Can I help you?" | She asked me whether she could help me.

Wh- Questions (use ask + question word + clause)
Direct Speech | Reported Speech
"What are you doing?" | He asked me what I was doing.
"Where are you going?" | She asked me where I was going.
