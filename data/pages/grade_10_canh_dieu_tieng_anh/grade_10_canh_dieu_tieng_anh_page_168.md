He has finished his homework.

Negative Statements:

She hasn't cooked dinner.

Yes / No Questions:
Have you cleaned the room?

Wh- Questions:

Regular verbs end in -ed:
walk - walked, clean - cleaned, pass - passed,
graduate - graduated, visit - visited

Irregular verbs have irregular past participles:
cut - cut, buy - bought, have - had, go - gone,
be - been, take - taken, pay - paid, put - put

A. Write the irregular past participles from the box next to the correct verb.
