A Read about Mac Dinh Chi. What did he achieve?

Mac Dinh Chi was a poor boy from a small village in Viet Nam during the Tran Dynasty. When he was studying in his hometown, he could not afford an oil lamp to read books at night. Therefore, he put fireflies into eggshells and used their light to read the pages. With great dedication, he became a leading scholar in the village and later passed the palace examination as the highest-scoring graduate in 1304.
