Claudia: I want to visit Japan next year. Can you give me some advice?
Ayumi: Sure, it's an interesting country.
Claudia: Do you think I should go in the summer?
Ayumi: You can, but it's very hot. I think you should go in the spring. It's a beautiful time of year, and the Japanese gardens are famous.
Claudia: OK. And do I need to rent a car?
Ayumi: No, you don't need to. It's a good idea to take trains because they're fast between the big cities.
Claudia: Right. I fly into Tokyo. Is Tokyo expensive?
Ayumi: Very! And it's so crowded. Why don't you stay in Fujiyoshida? It's not too far from Tokyo. It's a small city near Mount Fuji and the hotels are nice.
