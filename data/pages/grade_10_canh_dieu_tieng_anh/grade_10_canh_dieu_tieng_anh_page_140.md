# Vietnamese Women's Achievements

Women have always played an important role in Vietnam's history. Some fight for their country, some inspire others, and some make positive changes to society.

Trung Trac and Trung Nhi are examples of women who fought for their country's freedom. Known in Vietnamese as "Hai Ba Trung", the Trung sisters successfully led their people to fight against invaders in 40 A.D. After their victory, they ruled the country for three years. As the first female rulers, the Trung sisters have become examples of the patriotic Vietnamese women. This is significant because Vietnamese women had little access to education and politics at the time.

Suong Nguyet Anh is another example. As the daughter of the patriotic poet Nguyen Dinh Chieu, she mastered literature from a very young age. She worked as a teacher before becoming the editor-in-chief of the Nu Gioi Chung, the first women's newspaper in Sai Gon, in 1918. Being the first female editor in Viet Nam, Nguyet Anh made great contributions to the press, feminism, and poetry of the country.

A third example is Diem Phung Thi. She graduated from Ha Noi Medical University in 1946 and got a PhD in dentistry in France eight years later. When working as a dentist, she fell in love with sculpture and started practicing it. Later, she held several exhibitions around Europe with artworks about her homeland's people. She became the first female Vietnamese member of the European Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992 and her name was registered in the Larousse Dictionary of Painters.
