# When Your Hobby Is Also Your Job

Every day, we eat, sleep, and work, but most people also want more free time for their hobbies and interests. Maybe they want to play more sports, learn a musical instrument, or even write a book, but they don't have the time. It's a problem for many, but the answer is simple when your hobby is also your job!

Leyla Kazim is a good example of how to have a passion and make money from it. Leyla loves travel, photography, and food, so she writes a blog. "I spend most of my time either eating, traveling, or creating content about the two," she says. Leyla's blog has more than 100,000 followers and, because the blog is so popular, she also works with food companies and restaurants.

Michael Gazaleh is another person with a hobby that's also his job. He loves running in his free time and he also loves showing people his home city of New York. So his company, City Running Tours, gives tours of cities to people who also like running. "Every day, we get to run with wonderful people from all over the world," he says. Michael's company now has running tours in 14 different cities in the US and Canada.

So, do you have a hobby or a passion? How can you make it your job?
