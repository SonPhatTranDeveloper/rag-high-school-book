Conversation (Optional)

E Listen to the conversation. What was good about the weekend? What was bad?

Alex: How was your weekend?
Camilo: It was good. I went camping with Minh.
Alex: Really? How was the weather?
Camilo: It was bad on the first day. It snowed non-stop! Everything was covered with lots of snow.
Alex: Oh, no! What did you do?
Camilo: We went to a hotel, but there weren't any rooms. Then we found another hotel. It was more expensive, but the rooms were clean. Actually, they were repainted a few days ago. The food was good, and it was even brought to our rooms!
Alex: So, did you go hiking?
Camilo: No. It was still snowing on the second day, so we decided to go skiing instead. It was tiring, but a lot of fun. Look, this photo was taken right when I had the biggest fall of the whole day! Anyway, how was your weekend?
Alex: It was OK, but it was very boring compared to yours!
