"Crowdfunding" is a way of raising money from a large number of people on the Internet. When crowdfunding began, it was mostly used by new businesses. Nowadays, people use it for different reasons. Musicians who want to make an album can ask fans for money, a photographer can get money for a new book, and different types of charities raise money this way. Here are examples of how crowdfunding has made a real difference in the world.

# Bringing water

Sonam Wangchuk, an engineer, raised $125,000 on a crowdfunding site to build an "ice stupa." In higher parts of the Himalayas, the glaciers are disappearing, so local people have less water in the spring for crops. Sonam invented a way to bring water up the Himalayas in the winter from the lower parts of the mountains. As water comes out of a pipe, it freezes and becomes the 65-foot-tall ice stupa. Then, in the spring, the stupa melts and people have water for their fields.

# Saving the rainforest

The organization "Size of Wales" wants to save rainforests because they are disappearing. It has already saved 7,700 square miles of rainforest (the same size as the country, Wales). Crowdfunding is important for the organization because people give money, but it's also a good way to make people think about climate change.

So if you want to give money to a charity, visit a crowdfunding siteâ€”or, if you want to raise money for a charity, why not try crowdfunding for yourself?
