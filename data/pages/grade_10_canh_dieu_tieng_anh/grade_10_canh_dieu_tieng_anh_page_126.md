Conversation (Optional)

H Listen to the conversation. Did Greg have a healthy lifestyle? What about Troy?

Troy: Hi, Greg. Rosie asked if we would like to join her graduation party this Saturday.
Greg: I'd love to, but I can't. My grandpa needs a hand for his garden this weekend.
Troy: Oh, you know, she also asked me if we could help decorate for her party on Friday.
Greg: OK, I will come to give her a hand after exercising.
Troy: How often do you exercise?
Greg: I work out at the gym almost every weekday and ride my bike to my grandparents' house about twice a week.
Troy: That's why you're always in good shape. How many hours a week do you work out?
Greg: Around 10 hours. You should get more exercise, too, Troy.
Troy: Oh, I love football. I usually stay up until 3 in the morning to watch my favorite team. My mom often asks me why I didn't try out for the football team. It's a great idea, but I'd rather watch it than play it.
