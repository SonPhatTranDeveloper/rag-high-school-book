Real Conditionals

The Zero Conditional:
If Clause (Simple Present) | Main Clause (Simple Present or Imperative)
If you borrow money from a bank, | you pay interest.
If you receive a student loan, | don't spend it all on new clothes!
We use the zero conditional to:
• talk about facts or things that are usually true. | • give instructions or advice.

The First Conditional:
If Clause (Simple Present) | Main Clause (Simple Future)
If they have some extra money, | they will probably help you.
Use the first conditional to express the future consequence of a realistic possibility now or in the future.

D Match the clauses. What type of conditional does each sentence express?
1. If you get a job, __________________ a. I will have enough money for next summer's trip.
2. If you use a credit card, ____________ b. apply for a student loan.
3. If I save money regularly, ___________ c. you earn money.
4. If I bring my lunch to work, __________ d. you pay interest.
5. If you don't have enough money e. I will save money on food.
   for the school year, _________________

E In pairs, complete the sentences in your own words. Use the simple future, simple present, or an imperative form. Then compare your sentences with another pair.
1. If you save 20% of your income every month, _____________________________________________
2. If you spend more money than you earn, _________________________________________________
3. If you borrow money from your parents, __________________________________________________

Conversation

F Listen to the conversation. What does the tourist want? What instructions and advice does Jim give?
Tourist: Excuse me. Can you help me?
Jim: Sure, what's the problem?
Tourist: I'm from Japan and I don't have any dollars. I only have Japanese yen.
Jim: If you want to change money, go to the currency exchange.
Tourist: Where is it?
Jim: If you go down this street, there's a currency exchange on the right.
Tourist: Oh, thank you very much. If I change my money, then I will be able to get something to eat.
