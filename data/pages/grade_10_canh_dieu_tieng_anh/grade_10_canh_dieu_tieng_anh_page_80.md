Would you like to experience the life of Indiana Jones or Lara Croft? Do you like to explore the rainforest and be awed by the scenes you think only exist in the movie Avatar? Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng National Park is the destination to make all those dreams come true. This park was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003 for its geological value.

## To catch a quick glance

Our one-day tour takes you to the Wildlife Rescue Center for a close-up experience with some unique species. After that, you have a short hike in the national park across a beautiful mountain valley to a large waterfall. The tour concludes with a choice of a boat trip on an underground river or a barbecue-style meal in the Weapon Cave.

## For those with more time

Our two-day tour offers a longer hike along one of many amazing trails, a chance to see wildlife in their natural habitats, and a night camping in the Weapon Cave. You will hear our local guides tell the stories of the forest. Exceptionally daring and physically fit guests can also take part in a special night trek in the forest. Imagine looking straight into a nocturnal animal's eyes with your headlamp!

The first five guests to make a booking with us will receive a 10% discount.
