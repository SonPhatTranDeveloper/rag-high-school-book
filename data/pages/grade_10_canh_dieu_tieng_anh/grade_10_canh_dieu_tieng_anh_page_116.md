1 If you visit the Andes regions of Bolivia, Peru, or Chile, you might see women wearing unique clothing: bowler hats, handmade shawls, and lots of jewelry. This is the fashion of Aymaran women. The Aymara are an indigenous group of people from the Andes mountains and Aymaran women's clothing is very different. Locally, these women are called "cholitas" with their "chola" fashion.

2 In the past, it was difficult for Aymaran women to get good jobs or an education. They often lived in poorer parts of the cities. But in modern Bolivia, this is changing. More and more Aymaran women go to school. They often get well-paid jobs, so they now have money to spend on more expensive clothes. When French photographer Delphine Blast visited La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, she loved the style of the cholitas, so she photographed some of these fashionably dressed women.

3 Eliana Paco Paredes is an Aymaran fashion designer, and she says that chola clothes are in fashion at the moment. She has a store in La Paz and sells the clothes to local people, and also internationally. "We dress many people in Peru, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and some products we make go to Spain and Italy." Recently, Eliana showed her clothes at New York's Fashion Week, where they were very popular. "We're getting people to learn about what this clothing is, ... and many women outside of Bolivia want to wear these outfits."
