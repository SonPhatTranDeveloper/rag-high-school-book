Writing

E Read the email. Which of the three friends in C is this person writing to?

Hi!

It was great to hear your news! It's exciting, but you have a really difficult decision to make. On the one hand, moving to a new country is an amazing opportunity. If you live there, you'll learn a new language and see some amazing new places! You can make new friends, too.

On the other hand, you'll miss your family and friends. They will also miss you. You'll feel a little lonely. In addition, you'll have to do many things by yourself like cooking and doing housework.

However, if you decide to go, we'll all come and visit you! And also, it's only for two years. That isn't very long. So, overall, I think you should go!

All the best,

Andy.
