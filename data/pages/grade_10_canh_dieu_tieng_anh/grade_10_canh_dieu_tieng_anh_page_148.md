PRONUNCIATION: Conditional Intonation

In conditional sentences, the intonation usually rises toward the end of the if clause and falls toward the end of the main clause.

E 66 Listen to the sentences in D again. Draw arrows to show rise and fall intonation.

If we stop using single-use plastic, we will solve the problem.
