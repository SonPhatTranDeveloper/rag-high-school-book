Will and Be going to

We can use will and be going to to talk about future predictions. While be going to was traditionally used to talk about plans and will was traditionally used to talk about predictions, there is little or no difference in meaning.

D Rewrite the questions using be going to or will.

[Table showing questions to be rewritten using 'be going to' or 'will']

Will + Adverb of Certainty

We often use the adverbs certainly, definitely, probably, and possibly with will for predictions. These adverbs say if the speaker is more or less certain of something.

[Graph showing levels of certainty with example sentences]

100% - I'll definitely / certainly be happy.
50% - I'll possibly be famous.
0% - I definitely won't speak perfect English.

Note the word order:

(1) will + adverb

Robots will definitely / certainly do housework in the future.
Cars will probably fly in the future.

(2) adverb + won't

Humans probably won't watch TV in 2050.
I definitely won't travel into space.

E Put the adverb in the correct position.

1. We will travel to Mars by 2030. (certainly)
2. Humans won't drive cars in the 22nd century. (definitely)
3. My brother will become a famous singer. (possibly)

UNIT 9

Lesson A
Comparatives

Change an adjective into the comparative form to compare two things:

Your car is faster than mine.
These socks are smaller than those ones.
This book is more interesting than my last one.
My phone is better than yours.

The comparative form is often followed by than. You can also add much to make the comparison stronger:

These socks are much smaller than those ones.
My phone is much better than yours.

Regular Adjectives

[Table showing regular adjectives and their comparative forms]

Adjective | Comparative
cheap | cheaper
fast | faster
beautiful | more beautiful
fashionable | more fashionable

Spelling rules:

• Add -er to short adjectives to form the comparative: young – younger
• When the adjective ends in -e, add -r: large – larger
• Change adjectives ending in -y (after a consonant) to -i and add -er: happy – happier
• Double the final consonant on some adjectives ending with a vowel and a consonant: hot – hotter, big – bigger
• Add more or less before adjectives with two or more syllables: interesting – more / less interesting
