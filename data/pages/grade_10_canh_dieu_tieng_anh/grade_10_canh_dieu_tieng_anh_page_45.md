# E GOAL Describe a Place

## Communication

A. What is your "dream" vacation? Why?

B. You win a vacation for two people and can choose from the three places below. In pairs, discuss the places and choose one. Present and explain your decision to the class.

| My Son Sanctuary, Viet Nam | Adventure sports, New Zealand | Bahia beaches, Brazil |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| The temples at My Son Sanctuary in central Viet Nam were constructed between the 4th and the 14th century. My Son is a must-visit for those who love history. | Tourists come to New Zealand because it has an amazing countryside. It's perfect for canoeing in the rivers and bungee jumping off bridges. | The coast of Bahia is 685 miles long, so you can always find a quiet beach during the day. Then you can go to a beach bar at night and dance until the morning. |

C. In small groups, read comments from six tourists about vacations. Recommend a vacation from B or choose a new vacation. Give reasons.

1. "I like vacations with exercise and lots of things to do."
2. "After working all year, I want to relax by the ocean."
3. "I like sightseeing and visiting interesting places with a lot of history."
4. "I want to meet new people and go to parties!"
5. "I live in a crowded city, so I want to go to a place with nature and no people."
6. "I always go to the same place. This year, I want to do something exciting!"
