What is a good job? Is it a job with a good salary? Not always. For some people, their salary is good, but their job is boring. And for other people, their salary isn't good, but the job is easy. And some people are happy because their jobs are interesting. Let's meet some people with great jobs.

Maritza Morales Casanova is Mexican and she's from Merida. She's a teacher, but there are no tables or chairs in her classroom because it's a park. The children learn about nature in the park. She says, "Empower children with information... and they will change the world."

Jeff Kerby is a National Geographic photographer. Animals are difficult to photograph, so the job isn't easy. Sometimes, the job is very difficult, but when you have a bad day, you look at the beautiful views and, Jeff says, "life isn't so bad; in fact, it's really interesting."

Ross Donihue and Marty Schnure are mapmakers. For their job, they travel and they make digital maps of different parts of the world. One of their favorite places is Patagonia, in Argentina. Ross says, "I love Patagonia because no two days are the same. Every day is different."
