## WRITING SKILLS: Compound Sentences

A text with only simple sentences will sound very boring. As you write, try to connect short sentences with related ideas to make longer ones. The new sentences are then called compound sentences.
One way to create a compound sentence is by using conjunctions such as and, but, or or.
Example: I live in Vietnam and I love this country.

### F Compare the sentences. Then complete the rules with and, but, or or.

My name's Tanya. I'm 20 years old.       I'm from Australia. I'm in Toronto now.
My name's Tanya and I'm 20 years old. I'm from Australia, but I'm in Toronto now.

I can go to school by bike or I can take a bus to school.

### G Underline and and but in the personal information in D.

### H Connect the sentences with and, but, or or.
