# Electricity from the Sun

When you go home this evening after school or after work, you're probably going to switch a light on, turn the heat or air conditioning on, cook dinner, or watch TV. Whatever you plan to do, you're probably going to use electricity.

Most of us use electricity without thinking about it, but outside of the cities, people get light from the sun during the day and from candles at night. Candles are expensive and dangerous, but now there is a safer and cheaper solution to this problem: small solar panels are easy to use and can give electricity immediately.

When Spanish photographer Rubén Salgado Escudero first visited Myanmar, he said: "I worked in villages and the people had no light at night. Then, one day, I visited a village with solar lights and people's everyday life was much easier. For example, fishermen went fishing before sunrise because of the solar panels. Children could do their homework as a result of electricity."

After his first visit, Rubén showed his photographs of people with their solar lights and he raised money to pay for more solar lights. Now, more people in Myanmar have solar panels; these panels take energy from the sun and then provide 12 hours of light during the night. In the future, Myanmar is going to build larger solar panels for some of these villages.
