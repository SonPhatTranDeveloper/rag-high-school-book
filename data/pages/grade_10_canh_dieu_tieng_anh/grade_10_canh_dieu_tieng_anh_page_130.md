Writing

E Read the paragraph about a student's hobbies and answer the questions.

I love dancing because it's good for my physical and mental health. First, dancing keeps me in good shape because I have to move around a lot. By swinging my legs or shaking my body, I can burn a lot of calories and lose weight. In addition, dancing is a social activity: When joining a dance class, I can make friends with people who share the same hobbies and enjoy happy moments with them. Also, to learn new dances, I have to memorize them and use my brain. Scientists have found that the areas of the brain that control memory and skills, such as planning and organizing, improve with dance activities. I think everyone should go dancing to be healthy.
