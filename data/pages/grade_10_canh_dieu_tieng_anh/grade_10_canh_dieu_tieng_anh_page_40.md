PRONUNCIATION: Rising and Falling Intonation

When we ask questions with two options, we use rising and falling intonation. The intonation rises on the first option and falls on the second one.

C 15 Listen and repeat. Use rising and falling intonation.

1. Would you like a window or aisle seat?
2. Is this bag to check in or carry on?
3. Do you spell that L-E-E or L-I?
4. Is it for one night or two?

D Practice asking these questions with a partner. Use rising and falling intonation.

1. Are you from the US or Canada?
2. Do you want to pay by cash or by card?
3. Is your visit for business or pleasure?
4. Do you want my ticket or my passport?
5. Do you leave on the 25th or the 26th?
