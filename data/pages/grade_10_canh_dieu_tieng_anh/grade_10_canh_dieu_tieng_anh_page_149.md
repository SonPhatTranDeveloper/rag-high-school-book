Money Travel Tips

If you had a hundred million đồng now, what would you do with that money? Some people would open a bank account to earn interest if they had that much money. Others would use the money to travel the world. If you traveled abroad, you would probably need to change money. For example, if you visited Japan, you would need to change the money into yen. If you went to Brazil, you would need to pay in reals. It can be confusing! Here are some tips:

• Plan how much money you will spend each day. Then, calculate the amount in the local currency.
• If you change your money before you leave, it'll be cheaper than changing it at airports or hotels.
• When you arrive, carry your money in different places: in your wallet, your bag, and your pocket. Then, if someone steals any, you won't lose all of it.

C. In pairs, write the money verbs from the box in the correct column. Then compare your answers with another pair. Do you agree?

Positive | Neutral | Negative
--------|--------|--------
save    |        |

D. Choose five money verbs and write a sentence with each one. Then read your sentences in pairs, but don't say the verb. Can your partner guess the missing verb?

My grandmother plays the lottery every week, but she never ... any money.

Is the verb "wins"?

Yes, it is.
