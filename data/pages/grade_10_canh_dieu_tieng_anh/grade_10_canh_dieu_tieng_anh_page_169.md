UNIT 12

Lesson A

Real Conditionals: The Zero Conditional

If Clause (Simple Present) | Main Clause (Simple Present or Imperative)
--- | ---
If you have a loan, | you pay interest.
If you borrow money, | remember to pay it back.

We use the zero conditional to:
• talk about facts: If you throw a ball up, it comes down.
• talk about things that are usually true: If there are dark clouds, it often rains.
• give instructions: If you press this button, your laptop starts.
• give advice: If you don't understand a word, ask your teacher.
With the zero conditional, you can start with the if clause or the main clause.
If you have a loan, you pay interest. = You pay interest if you have a loan.

Punctuation
If you start with the if clause, put a comma after it: If you need help, ask your teacher.
If you start with the main clause, don't use a comma: Ask your teacher if you need help.

Real Conditionals: The First Conditional

If Clause (Simple Present) | Main Clause (Simple Future)
--- | ---
If you leave a message, | I will call you.
If you don't study, | you won't pass the test.

We use the first conditional to express the future consequence of a realistic possibility now or in the future. Use the simple present in the if clause and will / won't to talk about the future action or result in the main clause. With the first conditional, you can start with the if clause or the main clause. If you start with the if clause, use a comma between the clauses:
If you go now, you'll catch your train. = You'll catch your train if you go now.
