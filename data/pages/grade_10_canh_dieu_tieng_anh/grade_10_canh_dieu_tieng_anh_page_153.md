### A MY WORLD
We all have to make big decisions sometimes. What big decisions have you made? What big decisions do you think you will make in the future? Tell the class.

### B
In pairs, look at the list of life decisions. Discuss and rank them from 1 to 8 (1 = the most difficult decision, 8 = the easiest decision).

___ moving to another country
___ asking someone to marry you
___ buying your first car
___ applying for a job

___ choosing a phone
___ deciding what to wear to a party
___ buying a house
___ getting a student loan

### C
Work in groups. Three of your friends need to make big decisions. Discuss each situation and make a list of choices. Decide what your friend should do.

1. A friend is a very good cook. He wants to open his own restaurant, but he needs money to start the business. He thinks he should ask a bank for a loan. What should he do?

2. A friend has won a scholarship to study in the US for two years. She would like to study abroad, but she also likes her current school, her home, and her friends. What should she do?

3. A friend won over 10,000,000 đồng in the lottery. She is a student and never has much money. She also does volunteer work with a charity for animals. The charity always needs more money. What should she do?

A woman cares for cats at a cat and dog rescue charity in Hiroshima, Japan.

If he asks for a loan, he'll pay interest.

But if she goes away, she won't be near her friends.

She should keep the money!
