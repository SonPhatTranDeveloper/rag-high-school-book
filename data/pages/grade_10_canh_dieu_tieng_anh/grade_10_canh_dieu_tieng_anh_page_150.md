## Unreal Conditionals: The Second Conditional

| If Clause (Past Subjunctive) | Main Clause (Would or modals for Present Conditional) |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| If Mike used a credit card,  | he would get a discount for that product.            |
| If you saved your income every month, | you wouldn't need to borrow money from your family. |
| If you were rich,            | would you start your own business?                   |

The second conditional has two uses.
First, we can use it to talk about things in the future that are probably not going to be true.
If I won the lottery, I would buy a big house.
Second, we can use it to talk about something in the present which is impossible because it's not true.
If I had his number, I would call him.
It is also correct and very common to say If I were instead of If I was.
If I were you, I wouldn't spend all my money on random stuff.

## E Put the words in the correct order to make a second conditional sentence.

1. all at once. / some money now, / If I gave her / she would spend it
   If I gave her some money now, she would spend it all at once.

2. he would open / If he received / a new savings account / his wages today, / at the bank.

3. like to travel / a problem, / would you / If money weren't / the world?

4. enough money / worked harder. / for a comfortable life / They would earn / if they

## Conversation (Optional)

### F 67 Listen to the conversation and underline the second conditional sentences. Then practice the conversation with a partner.

Gaby: Are you traveling to Hà Nội now?
Sharon: Yes. There is a gathering with my relatives next week.
Gaby: Sounds great. Are you taking a plane?
Sharon: No, I'm not. I'm going there by train... You know... I'm saving for my college. I would go over budget if I traveled by plane. I would also ride a motorbike if I had time. It's cheaper and more fun.
Gaby: Really? That's going to be a great experience. If I weren't busy, I would go with you. I love visiting Hà Nội.
Sharon: How about next summer holiday?
Gaby: OK.
