UNIT 7

Lesson A
Defining and Non-defining Relative Clauses

Defining relative clauses are used to give information that we need to understand who or what the speaker is talking about.

She's the student who worked with me on the school project last year.

Non-defining relative clauses are used to give extra information which isn't necessary to understand the meaning of the main clause. We use commas to separate these clauses from the rest of the sentence.

I'm speaking to Mary, who worked with me on the school project last year.

A Unscramble the words to make complete sentences. Use commas where necessary.

1. we / many followers / Facebook account / whose / talked to / had / a student

2. my uncle / to / in the US / I / lives / send emails / who / often

3. where / Facebook / is / some people / a place / about their lives / they / can share everything / think

B Match the two halves of the sentences.

1. I lost my smartphone,   a. that has a lot of functions.
2. He sent her several     b. when we often go 
   emails,                       on vacation.
3. A computer is a device  c. where I stored all my photos.
