A. Hi! My name's Lydia Downie and I was born in 1993. When I was a child, I loved reading books so much, especially those about travel and culture. Between 2011 and 2014, I went to a local university and studied geography there. It was an interesting subject and I learned a lot about different places and cultures in the world. When I finished university, I didn't know what to do next. So, a year later, I made an important decision: I left England and started to travel around the world! I've been to France, Australia, Japan, Korea, and Viet Nam. They are all very beautiful countries. I'm still traveling now and I hope to visit more countries in the future...

B. Two days ago, we left Bangkok and traveled north to the province of Chiang Rai. It was nearly 800 kilometers from the capital, so we took a flight. On our arrival, a local tour guide met us and led us to a homestay. Yesterday, we walked 10 kilometers through the countryside and we didn't see any other tourists–it was amazing! The scenes were very calm and peaceful. We visited a village and learned how to catch fish in a nearby river.

They were so friendly, and the local food was so delicious...

With these simple boats, they went far from the shore to catch fish, and even came to nearby islands. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the town became famous as a port, and many people sailed here from other countries. Many of the fishermen turned into merchants. Instead of selling fish, they started to sell silk and spices. The port was famous not only in the area but also all over the world. Last year, it celebrated its 500th birthday and local people had a big party in the streets with music and fireworks. There were also displays along the streets about the town's history in both fishing and business...
