Hi Mike,
Do you know Leticia in reception? It's her last day at work today! We need a card and a present for her. Can you buy them? I don't have a lunch break today.
Best,
Yuka

Hi Yuka,
Yes, you're right. Let's celebrate! What time does she finish? I'll buy a card and a cake on my lunch break.
Mike

Hi Mike,
She always leaves at five o'clock. Thanks!

Hi everyone,
