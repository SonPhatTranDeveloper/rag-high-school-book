WRITING SKILLS: Describing Objects, Adjective Order, and Punctuation

Describing Objects
When you describe objects, such as clothes, you can use these phrases:
It's / They're made in (Italy).     It's / They're perfect for (jogging).     It's / They're so / very (comfortable).

Adjective Order
When you use more than one adjective before the object, use this order (from left to right):

[Table showing adjective order:
Opinion | Size | Shape | Age | Color | Origin | Material | Purpose | Object
With examples filled in:
beautiful | | | | blue | Italian | | | sweater
| small | round | | | | | swimming | glasses
| large | | new | | | cotton | | shorts
comfortable | | | | red and black | | | | sneakers]

Punctuation
Use commas between the adjectives: It's a beautiful, black, Italian sweater.

F Put the adjectives in the clothing ads in the correct order.

1. For sale! A (black / warm / wool) _________________ hat. It's perfect for the winter.
2. I bought this (Italian / stylish) _________________ suit 6 months ago and I wore it once!
3. I have two (leather / brown / new) _________________ handbags. Buy 1 for $25 or 2 for $40!
4. (Indonesian / silk / high-quality) _________________ ties in different colors. For every well-dressed man.
5. Buy now! Five pairs of (cotton / red and green) _________________ children's socks.

GOAL CHECK Describe Clothes
1. Write three ads (120-150 words) to sell items of clothing or other objects (e.g., a bicycle, phone, etc.).
2. Put your ads around the classroom and read what your classmates want to sell. Check that they have written their adjectives in the correct order.
