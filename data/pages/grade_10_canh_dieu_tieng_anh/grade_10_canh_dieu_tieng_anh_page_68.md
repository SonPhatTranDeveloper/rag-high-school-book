# eSports Go Global

In the past, people played computer games in their living rooms and bedrooms against their family and friends. But nowadays, gamers play online against hundreds of different people around the world. There are also millions of fans who love watching these eSports as well as playing. They pay money to watch the very best gamers compete in large stadiums. It's just like watching a real sport!

## Like other sports

"eSports" is short for electronic sports and, as with normal sports such as soccer and tennis, professional eSports players are very competitive. In some countries, like China and South Korea, there are competitions in stadiums with up to 80,000 fans. At these events, some of the eSports are individual, but most of them are team games. There are five players on each team and the winning team shares the prize money.

## Big business

As eSports are growing in popularity, they are also becoming profitable. Globally, the eSports industry is worth about a billion dollars. Large companies sponsor the competitions, and some soccer teams also have their own eSports teams.

## But is it a sport?

Of course, some people don't believe it's a real sport because eSports players sit in chairs and they are not physically active. But eSports fans disagree. The players need a lot of skill to win the competitions and, in the future, some people even think eSports will be part of the Olympic Games.
