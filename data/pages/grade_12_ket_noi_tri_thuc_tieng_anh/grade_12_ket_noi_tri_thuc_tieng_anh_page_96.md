2 Work in groups. Discuss the following situations and decide on the most suitable type of media to use in each situation. Provide reasons for your choice.

1. Your school's music club is organising a small concert. You want to promote the event and expect an audience of 30-50 people.

Example:
A: I think we should write an event promotion email and send it to 100 people. I assume 30 per cent of them will show some interest.
B: Email is free of charge, but many people think email advertising or marketing is not credible. So I'm afraid they won't pay much attention to email messages.
C: How about promoting it on social media? We can choose several social networks and create an event page for each one.

2. Your school's social awareness club wants to raise awareness of cyberbullying among teenagers. You have some information and videos you want to share with as many students at your school as possible.

3. Your charity club is collecting books and winter clothes for children in disadvantaged areas. You want to inform as many people as possible about the activity.

3 Report your answers to the whole class. Vote for the best idea for each situation.
