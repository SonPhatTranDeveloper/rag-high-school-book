Mark: Yes, but it's not just numbers. You need to learn so many regulations and build good working relationships with clients.

Lan: I guess he often goes on business trips.

Mark: Not really, but he works overtime. He sometimes comes back home when I'm already in bed.

Lan: You're good at maths, so you should follow in his footsteps.

Mark: Didn't you say last year you wanted to become a scientist?

Lan: (laughing) Yeah ...
