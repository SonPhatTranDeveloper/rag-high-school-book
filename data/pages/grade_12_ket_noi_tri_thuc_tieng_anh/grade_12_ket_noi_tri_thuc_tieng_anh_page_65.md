## Simple, compound, and complex sentences (review and extension)

### Remember!

- A simple sentence includes one independent clause.
  Example:
  My brother didn't apply for the job.

- A compound sentence includes two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunctive, e.g. and, but, or, nor, yet, so, a correlative conjunction, e.g. not only ... but also, or a conjunctive adverb, e.g. as a result, moreover, in fact, on the other hand.
  Example:
  My brother didn't apply for the job, but he was offered an apprenticeship.
  Being a nurse is a very tiring job; moreover, you don't earn a high salary.

- A complex sentence includes one (or more) independent clause(s) and at least one dependent clause joined by a subordinating conjunction, e.g. when, while, because, although, if, so that.
  Example:
  When I was younger, I wanted to become a driver.
  Because my brother is often late for work, he is never promoted.

1. Combine the following simple sentences, using the words in brackets.
   1. He left school with no academic qualifications. He found a well-paid job. (although)
   2. People learn English well. They will have a better chance of getting a job. (if)
   3. This job requires good language skills. It also requires communication skills. (not only ... but also)
   4. My dad attended a cooking course. He can open his own restaurant. (so that)

2. Work in pairs. Add more clauses to the following sentences to make compound or complex sentences.
   I want to become a doctor.
   I admire teachers.
   There are jobs that no longer exist.
   Some jobs will be done by robots in the future.

   Example:
   I want to become a doctor because
   I want to help sick people.

   Although my grades are not very
   good, I want to become a doctor.
