I. GETTING STARTED
At the International Cultural Festival

1. Listen and read.
Nam: OK, we've arrived at the International Cultural Festival! It's a very popular event in Ha Noi. It brings cultures from all over the world to one location!

Mai: Yes, it's a way to learn about cultural diversity, particularly by tasting food from different countries.

Linda: I'd really love to try Korean kimchi or traditional Japanese sushi. Japanese cuisine is world-famous, as well as very healthy!

Mai: Can you show us around, Nam?

Nam: Sure. Let's go to the Korean booth to try some kimchi and spicy rice cakes, called tteokbokki. I also heard that a famous K-pop group will be at their booth.

Linda: That'll be amazing! I might meet my favourite group there and get their autographs.
