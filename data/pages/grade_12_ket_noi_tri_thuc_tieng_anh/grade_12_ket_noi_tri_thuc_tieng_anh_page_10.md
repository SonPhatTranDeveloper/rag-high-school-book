## I GETTING STARTED

The diary of Dang Thuy Tram

1 Listen and read.

Mark: Hi, Nam. Your book must be very interesting. What are you reading?

Nam: I'm reading a really good book in English called Last Night I Dreamed of Peace: The Diary of Dang Thuy Tram.

Mark: Dang Thuy Tram? Who is she?

Nam: She was born in Hue in 1942. She studied medicine in Ha Noi, and volunteered to join the army at the age of 24, working as a surgeon during the resistance war against the US.

Mark: That's when she started her diary, isn't it?

Nam: Yes. She wrote her diary while she was working in a field hospital in Quang Ngai Province. The diary contains personal accounts of her experiences during the war, and shows her love for her family and country.

Mark: Wow! It sounds interesting. Is she still alive?

Nam: Unfortunately, she was killed by the enemy while she was doing her duty in the jungle in Quang Ngai Province. She was only 27 then.
