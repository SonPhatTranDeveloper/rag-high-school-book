WILDLIFE CONSERVATION NEWS

1.

More than 600 volunteers participated in sea turtle conservation activities held on Con Dao Island last week. Volunteers made sure that their spawning ground is safe. They also rescued turtle eggs and buried them in the sand. Sea turtles are threatened with extinction worldwide, and their populations have decreased dramatically in many places. That is why sea turtle conservation programmes are organised annually around the world. They attract many volunteers and help raise public awareness about the threats to sea turtle species.

Local authorities are taking measures to restore the coral reef ecosystem in Nha Trang Bay. They will organise regular clean-ups of the seabed and removal of marine debris. Diving clubs will also help by having their professional divers collect broken pieces of coral, re-grow them in underwater nurseries, and then re-attach them to reefs. Coral cover is expected to increase, which will help restore natural habitats and promote marine biodiversity in the bay. In addition, the bay's management board will also monitor the number of swimmers and divers to avoid putting too much stress on the ecosystem.

An exhibition entitled 'Paint for wildlife' will be held in Ha Noi next week. It will include more than 30 paintings by secondary school students across the country. Visitors will also have the opportunity to meet the young artists and discuss the stories behind their beautiful paintings. All of them will be on sale to raise money for the protection of endangered and vulnerable species. The event organisers hope to raise public awareness of wildlife conservation through art and contribute to efforts to save rare and endangered animals.
