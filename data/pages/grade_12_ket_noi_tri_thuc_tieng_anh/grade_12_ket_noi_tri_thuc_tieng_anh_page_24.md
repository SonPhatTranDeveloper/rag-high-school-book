Grammar

Articles (review and extension)

Remember!

There are two types of articles in English: indefinite (a/an) and definite (the).
• We use the indefinite articles a and an before singular, countable nouns when the reader or the listener does not know which one we are referring to.
Example: I want to buy a souvenir.
• We use the definite article the before singular or plural nouns when we think that the reader or the listener knows what we are referring to because of the following:
- there is only one in general or only one in that context.
Example: The sun rises in the east.
- it has already been mentioned.
Example: A boy lost a watch. A woman found the watch and returned it to the boy.
- we refer to a musical instrument.
Example: I'm learning to play the piano.
• We also use the definite article the with:
- countries whose names include words like kingdom or state, or countries which have plural nouns as their names.
Example: the UK (the United Kingdom), the US (the United States of America), the Philippines
- oceans, seas, mountain ranges, etc.
Example: The Pacific is the largest of all oceans.
• We do not need an article with plural, countable nouns or uncountable nouns which are used in a generic or non-specific way.
Example: Tigers are endangered animals.
