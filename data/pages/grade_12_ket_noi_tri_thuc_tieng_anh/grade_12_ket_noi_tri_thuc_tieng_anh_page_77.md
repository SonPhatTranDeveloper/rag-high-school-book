Review 2

Reading

1 Read the text. Match each section (A-C) with a heading (1-5). There are TWO extra headings.

1. Boosting students' confidence
2. Building their professional network for future careers
3. Improving their study results in class
4. Developing students' skills for future jobs
5. Helping students to enjoy the work environment

Today, more and more students are doing part-time jobs while they are still studying at secondary school. Having a job while at school can benefit secondary school students in several ways.

A. 
To begin with, students can gain and develop important skills that may be useful in their future careers. The real work environment can help students learn more new skills as well as improve existing ones such as communication, teamwork, or problem-solving skills. For example, if a student works as a waiter or waitress, he or she can learn how to greet and communicate with customers. Those who are equipped with various life skills can perform better in their future jobs.

B. 
In addition, having a part-time job can provide students with more experience and then boost their confidence. Students will become more confident if they have opportunities to work together with different groups of people. As we may know, a teaching assistant will help the teacher prepare and present the lesson or mark students' assignments. Students who apply for the post of a teaching assistant are required to meet and interact with the teachers, young pupils, or even parents at various age levels. This can develop their classroom experience as well as confidence.

C. 
Finally, those who have a part-time job can build more relationship for their careers in the future. The opportunities to meet in-person and talk to other people in society will help students create a strong connection with people who may be their employers, colleagues, or customers later in their life.
