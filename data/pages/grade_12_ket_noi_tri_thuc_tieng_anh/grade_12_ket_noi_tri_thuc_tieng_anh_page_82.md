Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had a huge impact on education. Here are some examples from around the world.

A. Digital portfolio
To apply for a university or a job, secondary school students usually need to support their applications with a list of relevant qualifications and work experience. Thanks to AI, they can now effortlessly do that online. A team from two famous universities in Singapore has invented an AI digital portfolio. This app collects data from the learning and working experience that students upload onto the app. Then the data is sorted into sets of skills which students can use for their job or university applications.

B. Educational chatbots
AI chatbots are being used in many schools and universities around the world. They can help keep students engaged in their learning by providing a more interactive experience. These virtual tutors can explain concepts clearly, answer specific questions, and give feedback on homework. Students can seek support from AI chatbots during and after classes so that they can understand the lessons better. They can also create groups on chatbots to share ideas about projects and activities. Engaging with each other using conversational AI can help students create a better and friendlier learning environment.

C. Virtual reality
Schools in Hong Kong are bringing fascinating learning to the classroom through the power of virtual reality (VR). This new way of teaching helps students learn valuable skills, provides "hands-on" experiences when studying history or geography, and limits potential dangers of chemistry or physics experiments. Guided virtual tours transport students back in time to study the history of Hong Kong or take them to tropical forests to explore endangered species.

D. Personalised learning
Experts in Israel have created a technology platform to support personalised learning. It collects data from students about what they know and do not know, analyses performances using AI, then offers them suitable assignments. This app has served as the main distance-learning platform for many Israeli secondary school students who are preparing for advanced examinations in physics. There are also thousands of chemistry and biology students who benefit from this software.
