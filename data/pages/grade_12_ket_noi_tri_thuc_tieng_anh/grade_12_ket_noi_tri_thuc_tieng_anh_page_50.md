1. Listen and read.

Nam: Hi, Mark!

Mark: Hi, Nam! Sorry I'm late. I got lost because your neighbourhood has changed a lot.

Nam: Yeah. It's been three years since your last visit. Anyway, do you want to go for a walk? I'll show you around.

Mark: Fresh air and a walk sound nice. Let's go!

...

Mark: Nam, there used to be a rice field opposite your house, right?

Nam: Exactly, Mark. But now they have built several high-rise buildings. The city is getting bigger and bigger.

Mark: Yes, more and more people want to live in urban areas nowadays. This is part of the process of urbanisation.

Nam: That's true. There are also new public parks and people can enjoy more leisure activities. In addition to the big shopping centre, there is a convenience store on every corner. And look at our new electric buses! Do you want to go for a ride?

Mark: Sure, Nam ... Wow! The bus is so quiet and comfortable! It's the first time I've been on an electric bus. Getting around is probably becoming more and more convenient for local residents.
