DEBATE CORNER

Digital media is any form of media that is created, viewed, and distributed via electronic devices. Examples of digital media include websites, social media, videos, video games, digital advertising, software, and electronic books. With the development of technology and smart devices in recent years, digital media saw a sharp rise. This raises the question of whether digital media will replace traditional media such as printed newspapers, broadcast TV, and radio. Below are two opinion pieces sent to our Debate Corner this week.

Nowadays, it is much easier and more convenient to access information via digital media. Most digital content is also freely accessible. All it takes is a few clicks, and you can read the latest news, watch videos, or see online adverts. In addition, digital media forms are more interactive. For example, customers can provide instant feedback, which can be used to solve any problems. In return, almost every organisation can reach its target customers easily via digital media. Furthermore, digital media is more flexible since information can be updated easily and frequently. By contrast, articles in printed newspapers or adverts on TV cannot be changed immediately. With more than 75 million social media users in Viet Nam and the number is increasing, it will not be long before traditional media becomes a thing of the past.

Digital media is very convenient, but its strengths are also its own weaknesses. Since anyone with access to computers and the Internet can post or share information online, it raises the question of how credible it is. On the other hand, traditional media offers information from reliable sources that are fact-checked. Moreover, let us not forget that digital media relies on the Internet and smart devices to work well. There are still remote or disadvantaged areas in Viet Nam where access to technology is limited or too expensive. Many people also still struggle with technology. So although digital media is on the rise, traditional media such as printed newspapers, broadcast TV, and radio is here to stay.
