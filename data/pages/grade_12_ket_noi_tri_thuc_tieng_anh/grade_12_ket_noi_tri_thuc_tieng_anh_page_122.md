Career experts' advice

Our Teen Talk magazine has recently received a lot of questions from secondary school students asking about things they should consider when choosing their careers. We've talked to our career experts, and here is their advice.

A.
First, learn about yourself and discover your personality type, beliefs, soft skills, and interests. For example, if you are passionate about working with people and helping them develop, you may consider becoming a social worker or a teacher. If you are interested in learning languages, history, art, and architecture, you might look at jobs in the tourist industry. Spend time thinking about what you want to do, and list what you are good at. This can help you come up with a career path that matches your personality.

B.
Next, you should take into account any career qualifications you may need. Many jobs require formal education at a university or college. In order to work as a doctor, for example, you will need to study at medical school for some years of general medical training, followed by several years of specialty training. But there are also jobs that don't require any formal qualifications. You can be hired as a server or barista in a coffee shop, for instance, and you will be given on-the-job training.

C.
You should also consider your chances of being hired. Some fields of work may offer very few positions. With technology developing at a fast pace, some jobs such as cashiers and travel agents may become automated or obsolete. However, other jobs are on the rise. Doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, for instance, are in great demand because of ageing populations and increased life expectancy. That is why before you make a decision, you should carefully examine the opportunities that a career path may provide.
