PROJECT

School-leavers' career plans

Work in groups. Ask questions to collect information from 8-10 classmates about their career plans.

Report your survey results to the class.

Survey questions
1. What kind of career are you interested in? Why have you chosen it?

2. How does your career choice relate to your interests?

3. What kind of training do you need in order to pursue your chosen career path?

4. What skills do you need to develop to be successful?

5. Is your chosen career in high demand? Will there be many employment opportunities for you (in your area / in the country)?

Now I can ...
• use sentence stress appropriately to speak with a natural rhythm.
• understand and use phrases related to choosing a career path.
• use three-word phrasal verbs correctly.
• read for main ideas and specific information in an article about things to consider when choosing a career path, and understand text structure.
• talk about the things to consider when following different career paths.
• listen for main ideas and specific information in a conversation about a career in teaching.
• write a curriculum vitae (CV).
• ask for and give clarification.
• understand in-demand careers for the future.
• do a survey on school-leavers' career plans and report it to the class.
