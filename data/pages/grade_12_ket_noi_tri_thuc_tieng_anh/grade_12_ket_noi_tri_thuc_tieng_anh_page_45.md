## PROJECT

### Eco-friendly habits

Work in groups. Design a leaflet to give away on Green Day at your school. The leaflet should promote an eco-friendly habit (e.g. saving water, reusing paper, recycling plastic).

Present the leaflet to the class. Use these questions as cues for your leaflet.
• What is the habit?
• How important is it for a greener lifestyle and the environment?
• What should we do to develop the habit?
