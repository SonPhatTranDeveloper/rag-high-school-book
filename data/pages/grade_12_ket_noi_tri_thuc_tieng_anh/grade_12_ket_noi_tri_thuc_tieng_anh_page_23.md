Mai: Well, I'm not really interested in K-pop. Can we first go to the British booth? I'd love to try some fish and chips.

Nam: The British booth is on the corner. They serve delicious British dishes and sell souvenirs of famous tourist attractions in Britain.

Linda: But where's the Vietnamese booth?

Nam: I can see it on the map. It's an open booth and it looks huge! Visitors can play Vietnamese traditional games such as tug of war and bamboo dancing.

Linda: They all sound fun. I'll try to join all of them if I can.

Nam: And we can also have spring rolls and bun cha - grilled pork meatballs with noodles, which is probably Ha Noi's most popular dish.

Linda: I suggest that we go to the Vietnamese booth first. I love Vietnamese spring rolls and would like to try bun cha.

Mai: Great. That's a nice idea.
