Artificial Intelligence in the mass media

The mass media has undergone many changes over the last century. Artificial intelligence has also had an impact on the media. AI has become an important part of all forms of mass communication.

A.
Nowadays, people receive so much information from different sources that it is difficult to spot false stories. This is where AI can help. The advanced technology is able to classify types of information and recognise news that is not suitable for the public. Furthermore, AI can automatically change data into various forms such as online graphic organisers, images, and videos. This innovation is a breakthrough in journalism.

B.
Social media is popular all over the world, and more and more people are using platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. AI can make these platforms much safer and help the users avoid identity theft. A typical example is facial recognition software that allows us to increase the safety and security of our accounts. In many cases, social networking sites require personal information, which can be verified via facial recognition.

C.
Although television has been popular for a long time, it is now attracting larger audiences because of new features made possible by AI. TV viewers can watch programmes with higher picture quality and a lot of special effects. AI can also provide personalised recommendations to different users. The software can help TV viewers find channels or programmes based on their preferences, behaviour, and history.
