CAREER PLANNING

Choosing a career after leaving senior secondary school is particularly important to students. Below are some practical tips for successful career planning.

A.
Making a list of job options is the first step in choosing a career path. People may pursue a particular career for various reasons such as better pay, job satisfaction, promotion prospects and so on. While making your list, you should learn more about each option that interests you and try to discover new career opportunities that you were not aware of.

B.
You should also identify your personal interests and activities you enjoy. Do you see yourself as a patient, responsible, and trustworthy person? Do you have a passion for music, acting, or working with children? Try to discover your personality and get to know your strengths. This will help you match career options to your personality type and interests.

C.
There is a lot of support for students trying to make career decisions. Start by discussing your career plan with your parents and teachers. You can also attend job fairs where you will have the opportunity to talk to career advisers, and meet employers and recruiters. Make sure you prepare well by researching the participating companies in advance and identifying who you want to talk to.

D.
Once you have identified suitable career options and done enough research, start working towards achieving your goals. How do you want to get there? Do you need a university degree or an apprenticeship? Are there any online courses or training programmes to help you gain the knowledge and skills your career requires? Write down everything you need to do and monitor your progress as you work.
