1. Listen and read.

Lan: Come in, Mark. Did you find my place easily?

Mark: Yes, I actually met your dad in the street and he showed me the way. He said he was on his way to work.

Lan: That's right. My dad is a factory worker, so he works in shifts. Today he's on the night shift.

Mark: Working night shifts must be really hard. When does he sleep?

Lan: He goes to bed right after he comes home in the morning when there's no one at home. My mum's usually at work then. She teaches at a primary school.

Mark: Working with kids must be fun.

Lan: Yes, she loves her job though teaching can be tiring. Getting up in front of the class and putting up a performance every day seem so stressful.

Mark: I agree. My mum used to be a teacher, but she gave up her job to look after me and my brother.

Lan: How about your dad?

Mark: He has a nine-to-five job. He's an accountant at a bank.

Lan: Working with numbers must be difficult.
