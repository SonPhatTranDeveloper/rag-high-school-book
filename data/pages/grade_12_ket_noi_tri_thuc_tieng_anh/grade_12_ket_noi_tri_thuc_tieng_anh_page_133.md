Grammar

Reported speech: reporting orders, requests, offers, and advice

Remember!

• When we report orders, requests, offers, and advice, we can use a to-infinitive clause after the reporting verb. Reporting verbs include ask, tell, advise, command, order, instruct, invite, encourage, persuade, remind, warn, etc. Some verbs are followed by an object + to-infinitive clause.
• The verbs say and tell are the most common verbs in direct speech, but depending on the context and meaning, we can use different reporting verbs.
Example:

Direct speech | Reported speech
"Sit down and stop interrupting the talk!" the club leader said/told Mark. | The club leader told/ordered Mark to sit down and stop interrupting the talk.
"Could you show me how to register for the course?" I asked my teacher. | I asked my teacher to show me how to register for the course.
"You should take up a sport to keep fit," my fitness instructor said. | My fitness instructor advised me to take up a sport to keep fit.

• Some verbs, such as offer, propose, agree, and demand, can't be followed by an object before the to-infinitive clause.
Example:

Direct speech | Reported speech
"I'll pay for your driving lessons," my brother said. | My brother offered to pay for my driving lessons.
"OK, Mai, we'll pay for the online course," Mai's parents said. | Mai's parents agreed to pay for the online course.

• Negative orders, requests, etc. are usually reported by not + to-infinitive.
Example: "Don't stay out late, Mark," his mother said.
→ Mark's mother told/warned him not to stay out late.

2 Work in pairs. Talk about what people around you often say to encourage you to learn new things every day. Use reported speech to report their orders, requests, offers, and advice.
Example:
My parents asked me to read for an hour every day. They also advised me to join the school English club to improve my English. They encouraged me to start a learning journal. They told me to write down my thoughts about what I am studying in the journal.
