Dear students,

In a few weeks' time, you'll complete your secondary education. Some of you may have already made plans for continuing your studies at university or vocational school, while others may wish to start working right away. Whatever choice you make, remember to keep on learning new knowledge and skills.

'Haven't we learnt enough in secondary school?', many may wonder. In fact, learning does not stop after graduation. It is a lifelong process. It involves creating and maintaining a positive attitude to learning for both professional and personal development. Lifelong learning is especially relevant in today's changing world. It allows you to adapt to changes in the modern workplace and widens your employment opportunities. It helps you make better, informed decisions and become a more well-rounded individual. In addition, it keeps your brain healthy and boosts your memory. Lifelong learning also helps you stay connected with modern ideas and meet new people as you participate in various forms of adult education.

'Does that mean I have to go to classes again?'. The answer is 'yes' and 'no'. Yes, because when you start working, you may decide to go to night school or enrol on a distance learning course to learn a skill or get a degree. The answer is also No, because lifelong learning happens all the time. As long as you are motivated, you can learn new knowledge and develop new skills anywhere. Uncle Ho is a great role model for lifelong learning. He never stopped learning throughout his life despite all the hardships and challenges. He learnt to speak different languages, including English, French, Russian, Italian, German, and Chinese mainly by himself. He even wrote poems in Chinese when he was imprisoned in China to keep his mind sharp. He took regular physical exercise, did traditional martial arts, and enjoyed activities such as swimming and mountain climbing throughout his life. We can all learn from Uncle Ho's lifelong efforts to improve himself.

Remember that learning is a lifelong journey. Enjoy every moment of it.
