## PROJECT

### Steve Jobs' early life

## VISUAL STORIES

Work in groups. Write a visual story of a person's life. This could be a historical figure or someone you know and admire. Do some research on their life or interview them.

You can draw pictures to illustrate key events in his/her life. You can do that on a poster, on presentation slides, or in a short comic book.

Present your visual story to the class. Use these questions as cues.

• Who is your story about?
• What are the key events in his/her life?
• What are his/her achievements?
• What do you think of his/her life and achievements?

1. 1955: Steve Jobs was adopted shortly after his birth by Clara and Paul Jobs.
