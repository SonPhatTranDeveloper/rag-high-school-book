# Grammar

## Verbs with prepositions

### Remember!
- Many verbs go with a preposition followed by an object. The meaning of these two words is usually very similar to the original meaning of the verb.
Example:
verbs with about: ask about, care about, talk about, think about, learn about
verbs with for: ask for, apply for, apologise for, wait for, prepare for
verbs with on: agree on, base on, depend on, rely on
verbs with to: introduce to, refer to, respond to, listen to, explain to

- In some cases, a verb and a preposition are combined to make a (two-word) phrasal verb. The meaning of a phrasal verb is often very different from the original meaning of the main verb. Phrasal verbs use adverbs as well as prepositions.
Example: work out, carry out, turn on, turn off, look for, look after, look up
