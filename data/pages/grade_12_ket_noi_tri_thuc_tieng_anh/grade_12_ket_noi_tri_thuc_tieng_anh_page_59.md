URBANISATION IN MALAYSIA AND AUSTRALIA

Urbanisation in Malaysia started in the early 1970s. At that time, only around 26 per cent of the population lived in urban areas. After a period of rapid growth, the urban and rural populations were almost equal in the early 1990s. Since then, the urbanisation rate has continued to increase gradually. The urban population, for example, rose from 66 per cent in 2004 to 74 per cent in 2014.

At present, Malaysia is known as one of the most urbanised countries in East Asia. It is also one of the most rapidly urbanised regions around the world. According to the latest statistics, over 77 per cent of Malaysia's total population now live in urban areas and cities.
