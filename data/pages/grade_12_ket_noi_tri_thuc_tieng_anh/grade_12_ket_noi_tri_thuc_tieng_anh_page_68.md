Example:
A: I think working as a teaching assistant is a very rewarding job. I can help students who have questions or need encouragement during the lesson.
B: I agree, but it seems like a challenging job. You'll have to be patient and explain the same thing over and over again. It can get very repetitive. Personally, I'd rather be an event volunteer.
A: Why? You won't even get paid for that.
B: I know, but I'll meet interesting people and learn important skills like communication and time management. Besides, volunteer experience can help me find a better job later on.
A: Oh, I get it.
