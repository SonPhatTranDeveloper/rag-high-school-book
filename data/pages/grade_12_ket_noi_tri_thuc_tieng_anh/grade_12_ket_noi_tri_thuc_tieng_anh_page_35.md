Mai: Well, we can place a big jug full of drinking water in the classroom so that we can refill our reusable bottles.

Mark: Good idea! Now, to reduce our carbon footprint, we should also make sure we turn off the lights and air conditioners before leaving the classroom. Sometimes people rush out and leave them on, which is a waste of electricity.

Mai: Sure. Why don't we place some brightly coloured signs next to all doors to remind people?

Nam: So many good ideas already. Let's meet after school to discuss more. I hope our class wins the ecotour!

Mark: That'd be fantastic!

Mai: Yes. Let's do our best!
