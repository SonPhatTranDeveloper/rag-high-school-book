# AI IN OUR DAILY LIVES

Your class is organising a Technology Fair. The theme is 'AI in our daily lives'. Work in groups. Think of a way of using AI in your daily life. This can be an existing or a new application. Use these questions as cues.

• What is the AI application? (If it's a new application, give it a name.)
• What is its purpose?
• How does it work?
• How will it improve your life?

Present your idea to the class in the form of an oral presentation, a poster, or a leaflet.
