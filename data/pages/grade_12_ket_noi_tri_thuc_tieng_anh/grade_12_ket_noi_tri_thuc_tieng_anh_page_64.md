Stressing auxiliary and modal verbs

Remember!

Auxiliary and modal verbs are usually not stressed in connected speech; however, they have stress in the following situations:
• when they are not followed by the main verb in short responses.
Example:
Can we walk to the cinema? - Yes, we can.
• when they are contracted with not in negative sentences.
Example:
You haven't applied for the job yet.
• when they are used to emphasise disagreement with the previous statement.
Example:
A: Nam wasn't interested in that job.
B: He was interested in the job.

1 Listen and repeat. Pay attention to the stressed words.
1. I don't like working with numbers, but my brother does.
2. I will help you with your maths homework if I can.
3. A: You haven't submitted your application letter for the job yet.
   B: I have.
4. My brother couldn't ride a bike two months ago, but he can now.

2 Listen and underline the stressed auxiliary and modal verbs in the following sentences. Then practise saying the sentences in pairs.
1. I would help you find a job if I could.
2. When he started his first job, he wasn't used to working in an office, but he is used to it now.
3. A: Are you ready for the interview?
