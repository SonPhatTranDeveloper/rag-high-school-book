2 Work in pairs. Talk about how to reduce, reuse, and recycle paper. Use these questions to help you.

1. Which of the activities (a-i) above are you doing?
2. Can you suggest more ideas? How will they help save the environment?

3 Work in groups. Read the situations below and think of some possible responses to promote a greener lifestyle. Provide reasons for each answer.

1. After a club meeting, you notice that there are a lot of leaflets left, and they are only printed on one side. Your friend is asking you to help throw them away.
Example: Do not throw them away. We should reuse these leaflets by using the blank pages to take notes, which will save natural resources such as trees and water.

2. Your group is preparing for a presentation, and everyone has found a lot of useful online material. A group member is asking you to print out about 50 pages of information for the group to read.

3. Your club is organising a meeting, including a game in which people should write down something about themselves to share with others. The club president is asking you to buy a lot of Post-it notes for the game.
