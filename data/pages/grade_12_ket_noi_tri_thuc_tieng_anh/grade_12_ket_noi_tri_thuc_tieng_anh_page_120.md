Sentence stress and rhythm

Remember!

• Content words (e.g. main verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs) are often stressed, while grammatical words (e.g. conjunctions, pronouns, prepositions, auxiliaries, and articles) are not.
• This combination of stressed and unstressed syllables produces the rhythm of spoken English.
• To sound natural and fluent, you should try to stress the correct words in your spoken sentences.

1. It depends on the industry and the field of work that you're interested in.
2. There're many jobs that don't require a university degree.
3. These soft skills will help you adapt to changes and come up with solutions to challenging problems.
