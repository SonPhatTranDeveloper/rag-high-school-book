Double comparatives to show change

Remember!

• We use double comparatives to show change.
Example:
Towns are getting bigger and bigger.
The air is becoming more and more polluted.
There are more and more high-rise buildings in the city.

• We also use double comparatives to say that two things change together.
Example:
The bigger the city gets, the more crowded it becomes.
The more we invest in rural areas, the more we can help people there.
