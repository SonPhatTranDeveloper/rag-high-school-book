A.
This report describes the problem of single-use plastics in our school and suggests three main solutions to the problem.

B.
Many students at our school buy bottled water or takeaway food. As a result, hundreds of water bottles and single-use plastic containers are thrown away every day. Besides, students often put containers with leftovers in them into the recycling bin, which can lead to contaminating the recyclable waste. This means our school produces a lot of plastic waste that goes to landfills and has a harmful effect on the environment.

C.
To solve this problem, we propose the following solutions. First, we suggest that the school should provide more recycling bins. Second, the Youth Union should hold regular sessions to teach students how to recycle properly. Third, we recommend that we make use of plastic waste in arts and crafts projects, for example, for making plant pots or bird feeders.

D.
Reusing and recycling single-use plastics will lead to a greener school environment and help promote a green lifestyle among young people. Therefore, we recommend you put the suggested solutions into practice as soon as possible.

Tips

A problem-solving report describes a problem and suggests solutions to the problem. It often includes:
• a brief introduction presenting the problem (and solutions)
• a paragraph analysing the problem and its negative effects
• a paragraph suggesting specific solutions
• a concluding paragraph summarising the report and emphasising the importance of the suggested solutions
