Australia is an interesting example of early urbanisation, which started at the end of the 19th century. At that time, over 60 per cent of the population lived in urban areas. Since then, it has maintained a gradual growth. This was also due to the country's immigration policy, which encouraged people to settle in its coastal, urban areas. Australia is now one of the most urbanised countries in the world, with almost 90 per cent of the population living in urban areas. The two largest cities of Australia, Sydney and Melbourne, are home to over 40 per cent of the country's population.
