## A visit to a high-tech centre

1 Listen and read.

Teacher: Hello, class. Please meet Jessica. She's a human-like robot and will be your guide today.

Jessica: Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the New Tech Centre.

Nam: Hi, Jessica. I'm so excited as I've never met a talking robot before. Let's have a photo taken together!

Jessica: OK. I'll get someone to take a picture of us, but let's go first to the robot exhibition where you'll see a collection of human-like robots from around the world. Please follow me. ... OK, do you have any questions?

Mai: They look so real! Can we interact with them?

Jessica: Yes, you can. They're all capable of answering questions and translating from different languages. Let me get this robot activated so you can talk to him.

Mai: Hello, what's your name? What languages can you speak? Where do you live?

Robby: Hello, my name's Robby. I can speak English, Vietnamese, Chinese, and German. I live in the New Tech Centre.
