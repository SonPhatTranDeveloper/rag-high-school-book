One of the oldest university graduates

Bertie Gladwin became one of Britain's oldest graduates after receiving his Master's degree in intelligence history from the University of Buckingham at 91. He started his degree at the age of 89 together with his wife, who was then aged 77. "I feel very satisfied to think that I've done an MA at my age," he said at the time. "When you're 90, you sit around and not a lot happens, so it's important to carry on learning and to broaden your horizons."

Gladwin left school at the age of 14 and never finished his secondary education or went to university. But he still found a satisfying job. When Gladwin retired, he became less active and thought getting back into learning would delay the negative symptoms of old age. He wanted to keep his brain active and learn more about something that had always interested him. Then at the age of 60, he earned a BA in Psychology. By the time he was 70, he had also completed a BSc in Molecular Biology. "They're fascinating subjects," he said. "I did them just because I was interested in them and wanted to know more about them."
