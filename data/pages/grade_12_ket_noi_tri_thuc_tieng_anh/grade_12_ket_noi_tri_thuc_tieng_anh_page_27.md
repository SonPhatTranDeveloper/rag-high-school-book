## IV SPEAKING

Planning a Cultural Diversity Day

1 Work in pairs. Discuss the differences between Vietnamese culture and some other cultures you know about. Use the ideas in Getting Started and Reading, and the table and examples below to help you.

| Country | Viet Nam | e.g. South Korea | ... |
|---------|----------|------------------|-----|
| Cuisine | e.g. pho, bun cha, spring rolls | e.g. kimchi, tteokbokki | |
| Music | | | |
| Fashion/ Clothing | | | |

Example:
A: South Koreans seem to eat a lot of spicy food, such as kimchi and tteokbokki, while our traditional dishes, like bun cha and pho, are not very spicy in general.
B: I agree. How about music? I think in both countries, young people like to listen to pop music, but K-pop focuses mainly on dance groups while our pop music is usually produced by solo artists.
