1 GETTING STARTED
Promoting a charity event

1 Listen and read.
Mark: Hi, Mai. What's up? You look so worried!
Mai: I'm so stressed! The school charity club is planning a music show, and I'm in charge of the publicity for the event. But it's so difficult to think of ways to attract people's attention. There hasn't been much interest so far.
Linda: Why don't you place an advert in the local newspaper? Everybody reads it, and I'm sure an advert there can help draw attention to the event.
Mai: It'll be too expensive. I'm afraid we can't afford to promote the show as if it were a big profit-making event.
Mark: I see ... How about putting up posters in the area?
Mai: Well, they're not expensive, but there're so many of them that viewers may not pay enough attention to our poster.
Mark: How about the Internet?
Mai: You mean running commercials online? That will cost lots of money, too.
