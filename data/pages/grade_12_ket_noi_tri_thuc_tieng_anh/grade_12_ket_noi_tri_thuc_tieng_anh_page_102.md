## I. GETTING STARTED
At a rescue centre

1 Listen and read.

Ms Smith: Welcome to the Endangered Primate Rescue Centre! If you have any questions during the tour, don't hesitate to ask me.

Mark: I've just seen a monkey in the enclosure. So are primates just monkeys, Ms Smith?

Ms Smith: No, primates are a group of mammals that includes not just monkeys, but also humans and apes.

Mark: What's the difference between apes and monkeys?

Ms Smith: Well, apes don't have tails and are larger than monkeys. Their brains are also larger. They're as good at using tools as they're at learning sign language.

Mai: So how many primates live here?

Ms Smith: The centre is home to more than 170 primates representing 14 species. They're housed in large enclosures.

Mark: I can hear some sounds. Is someone singing?

Ms Smith: We're close to the gibbons' enclosure, and the male and female gibbons are singing.
