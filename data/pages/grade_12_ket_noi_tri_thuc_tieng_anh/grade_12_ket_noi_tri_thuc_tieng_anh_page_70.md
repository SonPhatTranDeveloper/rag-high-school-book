Re: Application for the position of a part-time server

I am writing to apply for the position of a part-time server, which you advertised on your website on 10 October. I believe having a part-time job is a great opportunity to learn valuable skills.

I am in my final year of secondary school. I have some experience in the hospitality industry. Last summer, I waited on tables for two months at a fast-food restaurant. My responsibilities included greeting customers and taking their orders. I also served food and drinks, answered questions about the menu, and made sure all customers enjoyed their meals.

I am a friendly, hard-working, and caring person with a love for people and good food. I can also speak English, so I can wait on foreign customers.

I would be delighted to meet you in person to discuss my application. I will be free for an interview any afternoon during the week. I have attached my CV for reference. If my application is successful, I will be available to start work after 24 October.

Formal closing and Signature:
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Yours faithfully,
An
Nguyen Van An
