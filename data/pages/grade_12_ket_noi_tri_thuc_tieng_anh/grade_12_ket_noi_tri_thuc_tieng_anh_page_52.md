Grammar
Present perfect (review and extension)

Remember!

• We use the present perfect to describe something that started in the past and is still happening now, or something that was completed in the very recent past.
Example:
A lot of young people have moved to big cities to work or study.

• We also use the present perfect to say how many times something has happened with the following structure:
It/This/That + be + the first/the second time + Subject + have/has (done)...
Example:
This is the second time I have visited this city.
It is not the first time I have heard about urbanisation.

• We often use the present perfect for a unique experience with the following structure:
It/This/That/Noun or Gerund phrase + be + the best/the worst/the only/the most beautiful/... + Subject + have/has (ever done)...
Example:
That is the worst meal I have ever had in this city.
Moving to the city is the best decision my parents have ever made in their life.
