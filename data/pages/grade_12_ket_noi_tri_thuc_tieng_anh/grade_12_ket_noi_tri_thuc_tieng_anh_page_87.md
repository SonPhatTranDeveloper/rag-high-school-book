THE EVOLUTION OF ROBOTS

The word "robot" was first used in 1920. It comes from the Czech word "robota", which means "forced labour" used in a play by Karel Capek to describe artificial people.

In 1949, the British inventor William Grey Walter introduced the first machine which could slowly move in response to light stimulus. Ten years later, the first industrial robotic arm was installed at a General Motors plant in the US. Such robots are mostly used in car and computer industries.

The first robot to use Artificial Intelligence was known as Shakey. It was developed at Stanford Research Institute between 1966 and 1972. Shakey could observe its surroundings, create a plan, and find its way across a room or push a box along the floor. Twenty years later, a walking robot called Dante, which was capable of climbing steep slopes, was built to go into active volcanoes.

The late 1990s marked a milestone in the history of robots when Kismet, a robotic head designed to provoke and react to emotions, was created.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, more robots have been created to improve our life. The first self-driving car was launched on 8 October 2005 when a Volkswagen Touareg named "Stanley" won a racing competition across the desert. In 2012, the AI expert Geoffrey Hinton and his team created the first accurate visual recognition system.

In 2016, Sophia, a human-like robot was introduced. Sophia can imitate human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations.

In the future, we may see more robots and AI applications. Whether we accept them or not, they will continue to play an important role in all aspects of our lives.
