IV SPEAKING
Applications of AI in education

1 Work in pairs. Match each AI application (1-5) with its purpose in learning (a-f). There can be multiple correct answers.

1. speech recognition
2. educational robots
3. virtual reality
4. AI-powered games
5. chatbots

a. support students with disabilities
b. develop problem-solving skills
c. check pronunciation
d. develop programming skills
e. provide personalised support
f. provide interactive forms of learning

2 Work in groups. Discuss the questions.
1. How can each application in 1 be used in education?
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each application?

Example:
A: What do you think about chatbots?
B: I think a chatbot app is an effective application because it can help students understand difficult concepts and provide instant and personalised support throughout the course.
C: I agree. If available, we can use it during and after classes to clarify points and get feedback on homework.
A: Yes, but there are also disadvantages. Chatbots may not be able to answer complex questions that need making decisions.
B: In addition, if learners always wait for ready-made answers, they may become lazy and may not develop critical thinking skills.
C: That's a good point. Chatbots can't replace human interaction and lack personal connections.

3 Prepare a summary of your discussion and report to the whole class.
