EXAM STRATEGIES

Task type | Strategies
--- | ---
Pronunciation (MCQs): Identifying the word whose underlined part differs from the other three in pronunciation | 1. Try pronouncing all words and pay attention to the underlined sounds.
 | 2. Pronounce words in pairs. If any two words share the same underlined sounds, neither of them can be the correct answer. If they don't, one of them is the correct answer.
 | 3. Some letter combinations may have different pronunciation in different words so don't be misled by the spelling, e.g. heading vs. eating.
 | 4. Pay attention to any grammatical endings such as -ed for the past tense or -s for plural nouns, which are pronounced differently depending on the last sound.
Pronunciation (MCQs): Identifying words whose main stress placement differs from the other three in pronunciation | 1. Try pronouncing all words and mark the stress of each word.
 | 2. If any two words share the same stress pattern, neither of them can be the correct answer. If they don't, one of them is the correct answer.
 | 3. Be aware that all four options have the same number of syllables and you should try to count them.
Vocabulary (MCQs): Identifying the word(s) CLOSEST in meaning to the underlined word(s) | 1. Read the whole sentence, focusing on the underlined word.
 | 2. Try to work out how the underlined word is formed, i.e. if it has any suffixes or prefixes, or if it is a compound word.
 | 3. If you don't know the underlined word, try to work out its meaning from context, i.e. the words, phrases, and sentences surrounding it.
 | 4. Replace the underlined word with each of the answer choices. Words that change the meaning of the sentence cannot be the correct answer.
Vocabulary (MCQs): Identifying the word(s) OPPOSITE in meaning to the underlined word(s) | 1. Read the whole sentence, focusing on the underlined word.
 | 2. Try to work out how the underlined word is formed, i.e. if it has any suffixes or prefixes, or if it is a compound word.
 | 3. If you don't know the underlined word, try to work out its meaning from context, i.e. the words and phrases surrounding it.
 | 4. Replace the underlined word with each of the answer choices. The word that makes the sentence opposite in meaning is the correct answer.
Grammar (MCQs): Identifying the error | 1. Read the whole sentence, focusing on the underlined words/ phrases.
 | 2. Look at both the underlined parts and the phrases that contain these parts.
 | 3. Identify the grammar points that are tested in the sentence.
 | 4. If you're not sure about an answer choice, skip it and focus on the other ones to see if you can find the error or not.
Grammar (MCQs): Choosing the best answer to complete each sentence | 1. Read the whole sentence and the answer choices.
 | 2. Identify the grammar points that are tested in the sentence.
 | 3. Eliminate any choices that are grammatically incorrect. The correct answer should be grammatically correct and form a meaningful sentence.
Gap-fills (MCQs): Choosing the best answers to complete the text | 1. Read each sentence with the gap. Try to understand the meaning.
 | 2. Look through the answer choices. Pay attention to the grammar of the sentence. For example, think if the gap requires a verb or noun, and in what form - plural or singular. Eliminate any grammatically incorrect choices.
 | 3. Pay attention to the pronouns and logical connectors in the text, and choose words that maintain the right relationships.
 | 4. Choose the answer choice that makes a meaningful sentence.
