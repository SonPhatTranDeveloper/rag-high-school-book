Three-word phrasal verbs

Remember!

In addition to two-word phrasal verbs, there are three-word phrasal verbs that usually consist of a verb, an adverb, and a preposition.
Some three-word phrasal verbs may have an obvious meaning that we can guess from the parts, e.g. walk away from, climb out through.

Example:
The driver walked away from the burning car.
The thief climbed out through the window.

Many three-word phrasal verbs have an idiomatic meaning which is difficult to guess from their individual parts.

live up to | meet someone's expectations
cut down on | reduce
get on with | have a good relationship with
put up with | accept an unpleasant situation/person without complaining
go in for | have something as an interest or a hobby
get through to | contact somebody by phone
look forward to | expect something because you enjoy it
keep up with | learn about the current developments of
... | ...

Example:
She gets on with all the members of her team.
I can't put up with his bad behaviour any longer.

Three-word phrasal verbs need an object, which always comes immediately after the preposition, and not in any other place.

1 Match the verbs in 1-4 with the adverbs (a-d) and the prepositions in A-D to make complete sentences.

1 I have tried to contact the employment agency several times, but I haven't been able to get ...

2 After graduating from a medical school, my father had to work very hard to keep ...

3 I have sent them my CV and application letter. Now, I'm looking ...

a up
b forward
c down
d through

A ... to hearing from them.
B ... on staff.
C ... to anyone.
D ... with medical knowledge.

2 Work in pairs. Make true sentences about the career path of someone you know, using three-word phrasal verbs.

Example:
My eldest sister is very good at English, and my parents wanted her to become a teacher of English. However, she didn't live up to my parents' expectations. Instead, she went in for a game design competition and became a game designer.
