STEVE JOBS' LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS

A.
Steven Paul Jobs was born on 24 February, 1955 in San Francisco, USA. His biological parents were not married and gave him up for adoption. He was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs. In 1971, Jobs met Steve Wozniak, who was five years older than him, but they bonded over their love of electronics. After high school, Jobs attended Reed College in Oregon, but found the classes boring and dropped out after six months.

B.
When Jobs was 21, he and Wozniak started Apple Computers in Jobs' family garage with money they got by selling Jobs' van and Wozniak's scientific calculator. By making computers smaller, cheaper, and accessible to everyday users, their company became a huge success and sales quickly increased.
Although Jobs left Apple in 1985, he returned to his post in 1997 when the company needed new ideas. He helped invent new products such as the iMac, the iBook for students, the iPod music player, and iTunes music software. In 2007, he introduced the touch-screen iPhone which changed the way phones were used. Apple products were not only designed to be cutting-edge technology, but also to be stylish and easy to use.
In addition, Jobs contributed to computer animation. In 1986, he bought a small company, which later became Pixar Animation Studios. It produced the first full-length computer-animated film Toy Story, followed by other blockbusters.

C.
In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer. He fought the disease for several years, and stopped working in August, 2011. Two months later, he passed away.
He had four children, three with his wife of 20 years and one from a previous relationship.
On an Apple web page, a statement reads, "Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being."
