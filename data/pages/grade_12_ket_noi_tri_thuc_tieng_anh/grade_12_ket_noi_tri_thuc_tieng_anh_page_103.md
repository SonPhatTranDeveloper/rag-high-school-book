an ape

Gibbons are the smallest of the apes, and all seven species are regarded as threatened. In fact, five of them are listed as critically endangered.

Mai: What is the main threat to gibbons?

Ms Smith: It's habitat loss due to deforestation and illegal hunting. Poachers make a big profit out of selling gibbons as pets and for making traditional medicine and food.

Mai: So we can help gibbons if we stop keeping them as pets.

Ms Smith: That's right. Now let me show you Derek, the gibbon we rescued last week. He was locked in a cage for two years as an illegal pet.

Mai: Oh no, he's so thin.

Ms Smith: Yes. Gibbons can become ill or weak unless they're fed the right type of food. After examining Derek, our veterinarian also found head injuries. So we'll give him a suitable diet and monitor him for several weeks before we release him into the national park.
