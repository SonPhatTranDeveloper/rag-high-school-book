Relative clauses referring to a whole sentence

Remember!
We can use a non-defining relative clause to refer to all the information in the previous clause(s). This type of clause is introduced with the relative pronoun which. We also add a comma before which.
Example: More and more people are interested in recycling nowadays, which is good for the environment. (= The fact that more and more people are interested in recycling nowadays is good for the environment.)

2 Combine the sentences using relative clauses.
1. Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose in the ground. This explains why it is harmful to the environment.
→ Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose in the ground, _________________________.

2. Public transport does not pollute the air as much as private vehicles. That's why more people should consider using it.
→ Public transport does not pollute the air as much as private vehicles, _________________________.

3. All students work very hard to help clean up the school. The teacher encourages this.
→ All students work very hard to help clean up the school, _________________________.

3 Work in pairs. Talk about green things and activities you and your family often do. Use verbs with prepositions or phrasal verbs, and relative clauses referring to the whole sentence.
Example: I always turn off the fans when I leave the room, which helps save energy.
