**Mark:** Hello, Grandma!

**Grandma:** Oh hi, Mark. I'm glad you're here! Can you help me increase the font size of this text on my laptop? It's too small for me to read.

**Mark:** Let me show you ... You need to press these two keys together ... See? It's easy, isn't it?

**Grandma:** It works! Everything's so easy to read now. Thanks, dear. I still have trouble using the laptop. You know, it's taken me so much time to learn computer skills.

**Mark:** That's fine, Grandma. My teacher says it's never too late to learn something new, especially new technology, because it's rapidly developing. Grandma, you've typed a lot of text! What are you working on?
