HOW GREEN ARE OUR FESTIVAL TRADITIONS?

Festivals come with many traditions that bring happiness and joy. However, some of these customs may not be environmentally friendly, and may need to be changed for a sustainable future. Below are three of them.

1. Balloons and sky lanterns

In countries such as China, India, and Japan, releasing balloons or sky lanterns provides a spectacular sight. They are also flown for bringing good luck and sending wishes to the sky. However, the litter left behind the balloons and lanterns is hard to decompose. The frames of the lanterns can harm wild animals, and many animals mistake the balloons for food. Lanterns also caused wildfires in the past.

2. Fireworks

In Australia, the US, and many other countries, there are fascinating firework displays that people won't want to miss. However, fireworks actually release a lot of harmful chemicals into the air. Like sky lanterns, they can also cause fires.

3. Christmas trees

Real or fake Christmas trees are often displayed in almost every house, office, and shop during the festive season. When Christmas is over and the real trees go to landfills, they produce methane and carbon dioxide, which are two harmful greenhouse gases. Fake trees can be reused for many years, but during their production, harmful pollutants are released into the air. And when they end in landfills, they will take hundreds of years to decompose.
