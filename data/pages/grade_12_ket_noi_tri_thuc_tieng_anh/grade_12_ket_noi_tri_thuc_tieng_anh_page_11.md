Mark: Oh, that's really sad. But how did people find her diary?

Nam: An American soldier found it and saved it from being burnt. Then more than 30 years after Tram's death, a copy was returned to her mother. The diary was published in Viet Nam in 2005. It has also been translated into several other languages.

Mark: That's amazing!

Nam: Now she is considered a national hero for devoting her youth and whole life to saving other people's lives in the war.

Mark: Can you lend me the book when you finish reading it? I'd like to read it myself.

Nam: Sure!
