The effects of globalisation on cultural diversity

As a result of globalisation, the world is becoming more and more connected. This has changed people's way of life, beliefs, art and customs, or their culture, in many respects. Although people's experiences around the world have become very similar, globalisation has also encouraged cultural diversity. Below are some examples.

A.
Fast food chains and international restaurants have become popular, offering a wide range of dishes and more food choices to local people. For example, here in Viet Nam, we can enjoy Italian pizza or Japanese sushi, in addition to our traditional food. Moreover, some international dishes use local ingredients, which make them unique and more suitable to local tastes. On the other hand, Vietnamese specialties, such as pho and banh mi, are also gaining popularity worldwide.

B.
Thanks to globalisation, people can quickly discover new music from all over the world. People nowadays enjoy listening to music from different countries and cultures, and in different languages. For example, American teens are captivated by K-pop music and dance. There are also many music festivals around the globe that bring artists and music fans together. In today's connected world, it is very common for musicians across the world to work on music projects and share ideas together.

C.
Globalisation has also impacted fashion by opening it up to a variety of styles and influences from around the world. Cross-cultural styles that blend both traditional and modern elements are on the rise. This presents opportunities for fashion designers to be creative and reflect the cultural richness of the world. It is now easier for people to keep up with fashion trends from different cultures and regions, and express their identities in new and exciting ways.

In conclusion, globalisation has helped strengthen cultural diversity in the world and made people appreciate different cultures and lifestyles.
