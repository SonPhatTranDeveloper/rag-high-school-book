Adverbial clauses of condition and comparison

Remember!

• An adverbial clause of condition gives the potential outcome of a situation or condition, real or imagined. It uses subordinating conjunctions such as if, provided that, until, or unless.
Example:
What would you buy if you won the lottery?
We can't release injured animals into the wild unless they are treated and fully recovered.

• An adverbial clause of comparison describes how something such as a skill, size, or amount compares to something else. It uses subordinating conjunctions such as than, as ... as, or as.
Example:
There are more endangered species today than there were 50 years ago.
Gibbons are as famous for their beautiful singing as they are for their swinging movements through the trees.
