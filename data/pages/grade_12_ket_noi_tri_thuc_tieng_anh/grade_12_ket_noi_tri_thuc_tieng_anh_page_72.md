UNUSUAL JOBS

Around the world, there are some jobs that may seem quite strange and surprising to you.

Train pushers
In Japan, the railway system is huge and everyone there uses trains. This makes them overcrowded most of the time. During rush hour, railway station attendants called 'pushers' or 'oshiya' do the strangest job in the world - they push passengers into trains. They have to do this because of the large number of commuters who wish to arrive at their desired locations on time. That's why they must endure the pain in squeezing themselves inside the train.

Cleaners of the world's highest building
Have you ever wondered how the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, is cleaned? It takes a team of 36 window cleaners a total of three months to clean the tower's reflective windows. Working from the height of more than 800 metres, the cleaners face huge challenges especially during bad weather. They must be the bravest cleaners in the world.

Golf balls divers
Every year in the UK, millions of golf balls get lost in the water around golf courses. This gave rise to the demand for golf ball divers whose job is to dive deep into the lakes and ponds around golf courses to find the lost balls. Most of them are professional scuba divers, but they spend long hours crawling around in mud and carrying heavy buckets. On average, they find 5,000 balls per lake. After cleaning them, they resell or recycle the balls. Sounds dangerous, doesn't it?
