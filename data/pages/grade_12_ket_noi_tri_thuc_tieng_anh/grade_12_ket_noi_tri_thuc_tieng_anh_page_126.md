Remember!

In your CV, you should include the following sections:

• Personal details
Provide your personal information such as full name, phone number, and email

• Personal statement
Provide a short summary about your personality, skills, and career goals.

• Education
Give information about your education and qualifications. List the core subjects and the grades you have received or expect to receive. You can also include any academic achievements, awards, or extracurricular activities.

• Work experience
Describe your work experience, especially the experience related to the job you are applying for. Include any voluntary work as well. Use bullet points to highlight your duties.

• Skills
List your strongest skills, especially the ones related to the job you are applying for.

• Hobbies and interests
This section is optional. However, if you don't have any notable work experience, your hobbies and interests will be a great way of showing a bit of your personality.

• References
Make sure you have at least two references who know you well and can describe your character, skills, and work experience. It's not always necessary to include their names and contact details in a CV, so making them available on request is fine.

2 Look at the job advert in 1 again. Imagine that you also want to apply for the job. Write your own CV.
