## Ha Noi | Then and Now

'Ha Noi Then and Now' exhibition has attracted thousands of visitors this week. The pictures have brought back childhood memories to old residents while helping younger generations see how the city has changed over the years.

In the 'Then' hall, visitors can see pictures of 20th-century Ha Noi. Back in 1954, it was a small city with a population of about 530,000 **residents** in an area of about 152 sq km. The capital's famous Old Quarter or '36 old streets' dates back hundreds of years, with each street focusing on a different trade or craft.

'My parents couldn't afford a motorbike or car. Most residents used to get around by bicycle or on foot,' said an 80-year-old visitor. Trams, which began service in 1901, were a popular means of public transport until 1991. Buses were not very frequent then. People lived and worked in low-rise buildings. The city was a fascinating mixture of French **colonial** buildings and traditional Eastern architecture.

The 'Now' pictures show a modern city with a population of over 8 million people. Over the years, the urban area has **gradually** expanded to over 3,000 sq km including many of the surrounding villages. As rural residents move into Ha Noi, the government is providing more affordable housing. More high-rise buildings have also been built. Ha Noi has improved its transport infrastructure, building new roads and bridges. It is **modernising** bus services using more electric ones. The Ha Noi Metro opened to the public in 2021 and is expected to include more lines by 2030.

However, urbanisation has created new problems. 'As more people come to seek better job opportunities, the city is getting more and more crowded. This has led to more traffic jams and higher unemployment rates,' said a 21-year-old student. Air pollution is also causing **concern** among city residents.
