Reading comprehension MCQs (for main ideas)
1. Read the answer choices.
2. Read through the whole text/section and try to get an overview of it. Pay attention to the first or the last sentence of each paragraph, which is usually the topic sentence.
3. Do not focus too much on unfamiliar words. Try to guess the meaning of these words from context.
4. The correct answer should best summarise the main ideas of the whole text/section. Watch out for distractors, especially choices that are "irrelevant" (i.e. not mentioned in the text/section), "incorrect" (i.e. not true according to the text/section), "too narrow" (i.e. only representing part of the text/section) or "too general" (i.e. not specific to that section only).

Reading comprehension MCQs (for specific information)
1. Read and underline the keywords in the questions and the answer choices.
2. Read the text and locate the keywords, as well as paraphrases of these keywords.
3. Select the answer choice that matches the information in the text.
4. Do not simply match words or phrases with those in the text. Sometimes incorrect choices contain the same words as the text.

Reading comprehension MCQs (negative facts)
1. Read and underline the keywords in the questions and answer choices.
2. Read the text and locate the keywords, as well as paraphrases of these keywords.
3. Eliminate the answer choices containing the ideas/information mentioned in the text. The answer is the option which gives wrong/different information or information not stated in the text.

Reading comprehension MCQs (for inferences)
1. Read and underline the keywords in the question and the answer choices.
2. Read the parts that contain the relevant information. Note that the keywords in the answer choices may be paraphrased in the text.
3. Check whether the information in each answer choice can be inferred from these parts, i.e. it is not stated directly in the text, but is true based on the information given. Eliminate the answer choices that contain irrelevant information.

Reading comprehension MCQs (for referents)
1. Read the question and locate the part that contains the referent, e.g. it, they, him.
2. Try to work out the meaning of the whole sentence and look for any contextual clues around the referent.
3. Try to identify the correct answer by replacing the referent with each of the answer choices. Pay attention to the nouns in the sentence and check whether they are singular/plural.

Reading comprehension MCQs (for vocabulary)
1. Locate the word or phrase in the text.
2. Carefully study the context (i.e. the words/phrases as well as neighbouring sentences).
3. Try to replace the word/phrase with each choice to see which one fits the sentence without changing its meaning.

Sentence transformation: Identifying the sentence that is closest in meaning to a given sentence
1. Read the original sentence and try to understand its meaning.
2. Read the answer choices and try to work out what grammar point it could be testing, e.g. conditionals, cause-effect, the passive, indirect speech.
3. Eliminate the grammatically incorrect answer options.
4. Choose the sentence that doesn't change the meaning of the original sentence.

Sentence combination: Identifying the sentence that best combines a pair of given sentences
1. Read the two sentences and study the relationship between these sentences, e.g. addition, contrast, subordination.
2. Read the answer choices and eliminate the grammatically incorrect ones.
