## PROJECT

### A leaflet about a lifelong learning habit

Work in groups. Do some research and choose a lifelong learning habit such as reading, self-education, taking courses or having a variety of hobbies.

Create a leaflet about the habit and share it with the class.

Use these questions as cues.
• What does the lifelong learning habit involve?
• How can this habit be developed?
• What are the benefits of this habit?
• Does this habit present any challenges?
