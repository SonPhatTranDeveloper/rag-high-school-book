## I GETTING STARTED

### Green Classroom Competition

1 Listen and read.

Nam: Hey guys, look at this notice! Our school is holding a Green Classroom Competition. The greenest classroom will win an ecotour!

Mark: How exciting! But how will the classrooms be judged?

Nam: It says here that classrooms will be judged on the following: raising environmental awareness, reducing our carbon footprint, and using resources efficiently.

Mai: I guess we should start by cleaning up our classroom more frequently and having more plants in it.

Nam: Yes, this is the easiest thing to do, but we also need to change our classmates' behaviour so that we can develop eco-friendly habits in our class.

Mark: That sounds harder. I notice many of our classmates buy plastic water bottles every day and throw them away after a single use.

Nam: Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose, which is certainly not good for the environment.
