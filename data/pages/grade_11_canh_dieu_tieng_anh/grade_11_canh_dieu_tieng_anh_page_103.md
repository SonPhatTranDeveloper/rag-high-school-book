# Making a Difference

Human actions are affecting the environment, and if we don't try to change things, we will lose more of the natural world. Even though it is hard, we can make a difference.

In Madagascar, a fisherman named Samson is helping his community take better care of its local waters. He and the other fishermen realized that they were overfishing. Working with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Samson learned that they shouldn't catch so many young fish because if there are too few of them in the ocean, there won't be enough adult fish to reproduce. Samson now works to help fishermen change their techniques.
