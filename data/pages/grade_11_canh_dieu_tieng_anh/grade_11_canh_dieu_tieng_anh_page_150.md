Conversation (Optional)

Listen to the conversation. What are they going to celebrate?

Mike: Hi Katie! Congratulations on your new job!
Katie: Thanks, Mike. It was a really challenging interview, but I guess I did OK!
Mike: Well done! We should celebrate. Would you rather go out or invite a few friends to your house?
Katie: I think I'd rather go out for dinner. We can invite Lucia and Ana.
Mike: OK. I'll book a table at Italiano's.
Katie: Italiano's? I'd rather go somewhere quieter.

SPEAKING STRATEGY
Notice Katie's answer to Mike's question about what she'd like to do: I think I'd rather go out for dinner. We often use I think at the beginning to make an answer less direct and more polite.

Practice the conversation in pairs. Then, make new conversations. Change the situation and how you are going to celebrate.
