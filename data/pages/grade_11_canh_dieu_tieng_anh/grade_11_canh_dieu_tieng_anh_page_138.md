Conversation (Optional)

E 57 Listen to the conversation. What is the man planning to do?

Sam: What do you want to do when you finish school?
Isabel: I'm not sure. What are you planning to do?
Sam: I want to do a training program in web design and app development.
Isabel: Oh, so that means you'll have to work with the computer a lot, I guess. That sounds tiring!
Sam: Maybe. But it is the potential for future jobs that I'm interested in. What about you? Have you asked anybody for advice about career planning?
Isabel: No... I should talk to someone, right?
Sam: You should talk to the career advisor at school. Still, it's you who will make the final decision.
Isabel: Great idea! Thanks for the advice, Sam.
