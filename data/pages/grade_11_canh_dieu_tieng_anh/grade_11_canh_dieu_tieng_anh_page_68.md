Unfortunately, human activities around the park are threatening it. More and more shrimp ponds are being constructed. While bringing money to farmers, they prevent fertile floodwater of the Mekong River from entering the park. The lack of nutrients in the water, together with the common practice of overfishing and cutting down trees in the park, has put a large number of species in danger.

The local government has found a solution to this problem in ecotourism. Together with a number of national and international organizations, they are persuading local residents to make a living from the park in a more sustainable way. Families receive training and equipment to provide tourists with homestay services and local specialties. They also row wooden dinghies to bring tourists into the park for birdwatching during the day or to enjoy a rare experience of nocturnal sounds after sunset.

It is not easy for these farmers to turn into hosts and guides, though. To talk to foreign tourists, for example, they have to use body language frequently due to the language barrier. Luckily, those conversations end with hearty laughter most of the time. It may be hard for the farmers, but they are willing to learn how to make themselves, the tourists, and the park happy altogether.
