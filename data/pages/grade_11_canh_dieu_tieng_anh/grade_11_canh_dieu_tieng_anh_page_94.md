WRITING SKILLS: Using Sequence Words

When you describe the order of things or the steps in a process, sequence words help the reader understand your ideas.
Sequence words: first, second, finally, before / after___, next, last, once___, then, eventually

Example: When I think about my future, I have some priorities. First, I want to get a good education and focus on improving my English skills. With good English, I will be able to further my study abroad, perhaps in an English-speaking country. A good command of English can also help me adapt to the new culture quickly. That will open a lot of doors for me. Then, I will apply for a part-time job to support my study and learn some new skills. When I graduate from college, I want to come back to find a job. I plan to work for someone else for a few years to get some work experience and then start my own business. Next, I need to buy a house so that I can settle down. After that, I might get married and start a family. Eventually, I'll retire and let my children run the business.

Tell a partner what you decided to include in your paragraph. Explain why each idea is important to you.
