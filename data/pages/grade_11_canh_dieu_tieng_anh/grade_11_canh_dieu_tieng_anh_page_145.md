A Read about a special New Year's celebration.

New Year's Day is a holiday around the world, but people in Edinburgh, Scotland, celebrate it in an exciting way. They have a festival called Hogmanay. Hogmanay takes place all around the city from December 29th to January 1st. It starts with a parade on the night of December 29th. On December 30th, there are concerts and dancing. Finally, on New Year's Eve, there is a street party with fireworks, and people wear very colorful costumes. There is always a big crowd, even though it's very cold. One year, more than 100,000 people participated. The celebration in Edinburgh is very well-known, but the annual Hogmanay festivals in other cities in Scotland are popular, too.
