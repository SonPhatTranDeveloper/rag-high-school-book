For every common health problem, there's a product for sale to cure it. Are you suffering from insomnia? There's a pill to help you fall asleep. Did a pimple appear on your face? There's a cream for that. If you have a headache after a long day at work, or perhaps a sore throat and fever, you can buy something to make you feel better. Do you have indigestion because you ate the wrong kind of food? There's a pill to end the burning feeling in your stomach. If food won't stay in your stomach at all, you can take some medicine to end the nausea. Or maybe you ate too fast, so now you have the hiccups. Well, you won't find anything at the pharmacy for hiccups, but there's probably a company working on a new product for that right now.
