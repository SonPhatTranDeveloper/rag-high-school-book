D Read the paragraph from an Internet food blog. Notice the main idea (underlined) and the details that support the main idea.

There are many good dishes to serve at a dinner party, but I recommend baked lasagna. It is great for parties because it is a dish you can make in advance. For example, if you have time the night before the party, you can make the lasagna and put it in the refrigerator until the next day. In addition, everyone seems to like lasagna. If your guests eat meat, you can make a meat and cheese lasagna, but if your guests are vegetarian, a vegetable lasagna is just as delicious. A good tomato sauce, together with the pasta and other ingredients, is really all you need. Lasagna can even be vegan if you can find good vegan "cheese" at the store. Finally, it's a good party food because you don't need to prepare a lot of other dishes when you serve lasagna. A simple green salad and some Italian bread go well with lasagna. And maybe some dessertâ€”after all, it is a party!

vegetarian (n) a person who does not eat meat, fish, or chicken
vegan (adj) containing no animal foods, including milk, cheese, or eggs

REAL LANGUAGE
Quotation marks can tell us a word is being used in an uncommon way. For example, vegan "cheese" is not made from milk.
