Language Expansion: Participial Adjectives

A Read the article. What are the noun forms of the words in blue?

A. J. Coston isn't waiting to start his dream job. At age 18, he's a weekend volunteer firefighter in the United States. During the week, he lives at home with his mom, dad, and sister, and does his main job: going to high school. "I have always wanted to get into firefighting... since I was a little kid watching fire trucks go by," he says. "One day I was bored and on the Internet, and I found out that Loudoun County offered a junior firefighter program."

Some of A. J.'s friends are surprised by his decision to spend weekends at the firehouse, but to A. J., helping people is more satisfying than anything else. The job is never boring, either, since firefighters get called to all sorts of emergencies. One terrifying moment for A. J. was getting an emergency call after four children were struck by lightning. Luckily, all four survived.

A. J. will be off to college next fall and plans to study what he's most interested in: emergency medical care. "I want to be a flight medic on a helicopter eventually," he says.

Flight medics prepare for takeoff.

Grammar (See Grammar Reference p. 157)

Cleft sentences It is / was... that...

Cleft sentences are used to emphasize a part of the sentence. In a cleft sentence, a message is divided across two clauses. The It-clause emphasizes the focused information while the that-clause contains the remaining information.

Did Jane organize the meeting? - No, it was Susan that organized the meeting.
Did Susan meet the employees? - No, it was the candidates that Susan met.
Did she meet them in the cafe? - No, it was in the office that she met them.
Does she work at District 1? - No, it is District 2 that she works at.

If the focus is a person, we can use who instead of that.

A: Is the boss making the task difficult for you?
B: No, it is the assistant that / who is causing us difficulties.

We can leave that or who out if it is the object of the verb.

It was Mary (that / who) I called yesterday.

For our company, it is your experience (that) we value the most.

If the focus is a plural subject, the verb in the It-clause is still singular.

It is the managers that / who are interviewing John.

It was the application processes that made us tired, not the job.
