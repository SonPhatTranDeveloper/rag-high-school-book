Hội An Ancient Town used to be one of the most bustling trading ports in Southeast Asia, thanks to the canals cutting through it. From the 15th to the 19th century, many kinds of goods—silk, china, pottery, and spices—were exchanged among traders from all over the world. Trading activities declined in the late 19th century, but the lively spirit still remains in this little port town.

Hội An Ancient Town features a mixture of diverse architectural styles. In particular, Chinese, Japanese, and French cultural influences are evident in the architecture of Hội An Ancient Town. The cultural mixture is reflected in wooden Chinese-inspired temples and colorful French-style buildings. It is also reflected in the Vietnamese tube houses and the iconic Japanese Covered Bridge with its pagoda.

What is also special about Hội An is the lantern festival. It is held on the 14th night of every lunar month when the moon is the fullest and brightest. At 8 p.m., all fluorescent lights are turned off, and the lanterns are lit up by candles. People can enjoy the peaceful atmosphere with the traditional character of Hội An.

Over the centuries, Hội An Ancient Town is still in an excellent state of preservation. Its antique beauty and rich culture have attracted many tourists around the world.
