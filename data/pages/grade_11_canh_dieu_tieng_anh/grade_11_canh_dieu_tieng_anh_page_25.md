A GOAL Talk about Yourself

Vocabulary

A Read.

Every culture around the world has different customs and different ways of communicating. So when you learn a language, you learn more than words.

People use language to communicate many different things. Greetings, such as "Hello" or "How are you?" show that we are friendly or polite. We also use language to connect with each other. Using the right words can show our family members that we love them, for example. We might also become friends with people who we speak to every day. Another good way to connect with people is by talking about our personal experiences.

In some cultures, it is common to ask questions when you meet someone for the first time. You might ask a new neighbor, "Have you recently moved to this city?" This kind of conversation can increase feelings of trust between people. In other cultures, though, asking this kind of question could make people uncomfortable. Once you have learned the rules of a language, you can communicate more easily and avoid communication problems.

Selfies are an important part of how we talk about ourselves now!
