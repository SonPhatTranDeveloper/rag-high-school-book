Conversation (Optional)

D 47 Listen to the conversation with your book closed. Why is Luisa interested in mail delivery in the past?
Luisa: Hi, Carl. Can I ask you a question?
Carl: Sure. Go ahead.
Luisa: What do you know about how mail used to be delivered?
Carl: Do you mean letters and packages? Well, I guess they were taken on horseback to places in the same country, and by ship to other countries.
Luisa: Right, so it used to take a really long time.
Carl: Oh yes! When the telegram was invented in the 1800s, people were finally able to send messages quickly.
Luisa: Then, in the 20th century, when the Internet was developed, everything changed in communication!
Carl: Definitely! But why are you asking me about mail delivery?
Luisa: I'm giving a presentation in my history class on how communication has changed over the years. I was just practicing for it!
Carl: Well, I hope I helped! Good luck!
Luisa: Thanks, Carl!
