### Tips for a Healthy Diet

Nowadays, many people are trying to eat a healthier diet. Eating healthy meals is not hard to do. Here are some easy ways to eat better:

• Take the time to prepare delicious dishes that are also good for you. Food you make at home is usually healthier than food from a restaurant or cafeteria.

• Eat dishes with healthy ingredients, such as vegetables, and ones without much sugar or salt.

In many places, fresh food is available at farmers' markets. Farmers bring a variety of crops to these markets, including many kinds of fruits and vegetables.

Although most of your meals should be healthy, it is fine to enjoy some ice cream or cookies on special occasions like your birthday.
