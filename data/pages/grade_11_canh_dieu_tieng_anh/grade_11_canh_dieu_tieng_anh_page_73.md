A Read the information.

Nadia Drake is a writer for National Geographic and the daughter of a famous astronomer. As a child, she attended lectures and other events with her dad. It may have been her relationship with him that eventually led her to develop her own love of astronomy. Astronomy isn't Drake's only interest, though. She also has a PhD in genetics, and before she earned that degree, she had worked as a professional ballet dancer. Then, she realized that writing about science was the career she wanted. Once she had chosen this direction for her career, many interesting opportunities opened up for her. For example, Drake recently wrote an article about a photographer who used cameras to learn about wild rainforest animals in Peru. "This is basically my dream job," she says. The negative part of the job might be that her schedule is not very regular. The positive part is the writing, so she is happy with the choice she made.

With before or after, we often use the simple past instead of the past perfect, since the time relationship is clear.
