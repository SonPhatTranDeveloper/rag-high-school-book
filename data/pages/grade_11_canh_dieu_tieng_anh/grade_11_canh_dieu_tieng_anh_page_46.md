Read the paragraph.

Green spaces increase the quality of life in cities. Parks, beaches, and other green spaces are good places to be active. Every morning, a lot of people go jogging, do yoga, play badminton, or walk in the park. In the afternoon, beaches are the favorite places to watch sunset for others. Playing sports and doing other kinds of recreation help people in cities stay healthy. Furthermore, these spaces give people contact with nature. Seeing green plants and hearing birds in the trees are pleasant breaks from a noisy city. Therefore, green spaces are good not only for people's physical health but also for their mental health. Moreover, because they are good places for special events, green spaces can make communities stronger. Hearing a concert in the park with friends and neighbors, for example, is a great way to enjoy city life. Though the busy life in cities may make it hard for people to know even their next-door neighbors, green spaces provide great opportunities to meet other people, while at the same time enjoying a positive atmosphere.
