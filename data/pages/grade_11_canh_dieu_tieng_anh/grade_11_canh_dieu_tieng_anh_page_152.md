# The Rituals

## of an Important Life Event

Weddings have always been important moments for families and societies. Not surprisingly, they involve celebrations and rituals. Apart from the religious celebrations, there are many interesting elements in Southeast Asian countries' wedding rituals.

1. ________ is usually held the night before the wedding ceremony. In this event, gifts are presented after older women in the family give the bride some tips on how to behave well toward her husband's family. The most common gifts are gold pieces and gold jewelry. These are considered the bride's dowry and also a way to help the couple to partly cover the expenses of starting their own family.

2. ________, it is not gold but water that plays a central role in Thai wedding rituals. While the bride and the groom sit next to each other and are joined by a headdress made from a single white thread (the Mong Kol), their most honored guests will use a blessed conch shell to pour water on their hands. The water is also blessed from a ceremony that was held earlier. This ritual is believed to bring good luck to the couple.

3. ________, however, good luck is brought about by henna. A natural dye made from the henna plant, henna has been used for centuries as a form of body art. Before the wedding ceremony, the bride has henna patterns applied to her palms, her hands, and her feet. People believe that the deeper the color of henna is, the happier the couple's marriage will be.
