Conversation

Close your book and listen to the conversation. How old is Jamal?

Andrea: Did you hear the big news? Jamal is getting his own apartment!
Kim: Seriously? But he's 19! That's too young to get your own place.
Andrea: Oh, I don't know about that.
Kim: Do you think he's old enough?
Andrea: Well, he's mature, and he's had a part-time job since he was 17.
Kim: That's true... but I think he should wait a few years.
Andrea: Really? What do you think is the best age to live on your own?
Kim: I think people should get their own place after they've finished college.
Andrea: That's a good point. I plan to live with my parents while I'm in college.

REAL LANGUAGE
You can say Oh, I don't know about that to disagree politely with someone.
