Writing

WRITING SKILLS: Using Time Expressions

Time expressions help your reader understand when different events happened.

As soon as he realized his mistake, he apologized for it.
This means there was no delay. He didn't wait until later to apologize.

We had already read about Einstein's early life, so we didn't need to hear a lecture about it.
The word already emphasizes that the reading happened before the lecture.

Example time expressions: until / by + date or time   never   last week / month / year
                                after that   eventually   a week / month / year ago

Sample paragraph:
When I finished middle school and started high school, my parents began to give me more responsibilities. I had already started to wash some of my own clothes when I had no homework to do, but that summer it became my responsibility to do laundry for the whole family. My other chore was buying groceries for my elderly grandmother, who lived a few blocks away from my neighborhood. I went to visit her twice a week, and I asked her what she needed from the grocery store. She gave me the shopping list and some money, and I returned with her food, soap, and other necessities. It wasn't hard to do at all. In fact, it was fun and I really enjoyed spending time with her that way. I also began to feel good about doing my family's laundry each week. It felt like I was learning to take responsibility and moving from childhood toward adulthood.
