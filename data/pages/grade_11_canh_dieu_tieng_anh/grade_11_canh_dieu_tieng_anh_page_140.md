A stereotype is a fixed belief about a group or individual. These stereotypes are not based on facts but on opinions, and they still exist in our society in different ways.

Among these are gender stereotypes— overly simple beliefs about the characteristics and abilities of men and women. Gender stereotypes may have negative effects on both genders. This includes having inaccurate ideas, making wrong judgments about people, or limiting people's potential and opportunities.

However, as technology grows and people have greater access to education and knowledge, gender stereotypes are not quite as common as in the past. In the workplace, people are getting more freedom to follow their dream jobs, especially those that were once reserved for the opposite gender. One example is in the field of aviation, where the job of a pilot used to be just for men. While some people still believe that men are better at navigation and thus better fit for flying a plane, the number of female pilots has increased steadily over years. On the other hand, the healthcare industry is witnessing more and more men working as nurses—a role that used to be dominated by women.

While these two examples show that gender stereotypes are decreasing in the modern world, some people still have these old-fashioned beliefs without being aware. Then, how can this be solved? Raising people's awareness of the existence of stereotypes will be the first step. Be kind to everyone, and learn to accept each other's differences. And if you're planning your career or thinking about changing careers, remember the importance of independence, self-confidence, and the passion to follow your dreams.
