People walking down the Shibuya Crossing, one of the world's busiest crosswalks, in Tokyo, Japan

In the past, Engwicht says, streets belonged to everybody. Children played there, and people walked to work or to stores. Now, however, most city engineers design streets for vehicles. People stay inside buildings to get away from the crowded sidewalks, the noisy streets, and the dangerous traffic. Unfortunately, this gives them less contact with their neighbors.

Many cities are working to make their streets safer for pedestrians. There are new crosswalks on the streets and more traffic lights and bicycle lanes. The city of Florence, Italy, only allows cars and buses with special permits to drive on its historic city streets. In Boston, US, the Slow Streets Program gives some neighborhoods more stop signs and a 20 mph (32 kph) speed limit.

Engwicht travels around the world, helping people think differently about pedestrians, streets, and neighborhoods. Whether we live in a small town or a city with a population in the millions, Engwicht says we should think of streets as our "outdoor living room." Changing the traffic is just the beginning. In the future, streets may again be safe places for people, and walking will be an even better form of transportation than it is now.
