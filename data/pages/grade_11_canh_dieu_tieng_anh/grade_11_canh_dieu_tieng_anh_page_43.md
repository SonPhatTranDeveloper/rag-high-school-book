## Streets for People

Walking is a great way to get around. For short trips, for exercise, or just for fun, walking can be better than driving or riding. But in many cities, walking can also be dangerous. Cars, trucks, and motorcycles are a danger to pedestrians, and sometimes there are accidents.

David Engwicht, from Brisbane, Australia, wants to do something about this. His book, Reclaiming Our Cities and Towns, has a simple message: We need to take back our streets and make them better places for walking.
