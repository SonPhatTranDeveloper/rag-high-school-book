# Conversation

Close your book and listen to the conversation.

Ben: How do you like living in your neighborhood?
Sarah: Well, it has a lot of beautiful old buildings, but there are some problems.
Ben: Like what?
Sarah: It doesn't have many different stores. There's only one supermarket, so the food is very expensive.
Ben: That sounds like a pretty big problem.
Sarah: It is, but the city is building a new shopping center now. Next year, we'll have more stores.

Practice the conversation in pairs. Then discuss the questions.

1. What is good about the neighborhood? What is bad?
2. How will the neighborhood be different in the future?

Write the words or phrases from the box in the correct column in your notebook. Add two more ideas to each column.
