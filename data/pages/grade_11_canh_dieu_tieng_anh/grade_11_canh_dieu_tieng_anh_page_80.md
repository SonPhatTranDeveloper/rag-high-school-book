Advances in digital technologies have provided innovative strategies for teaching from a distance. This has made distance learning more interactive. In the past, distance learning usually included no in-person interaction between teachers and students. However, digital forms of communication have changed the distance-learning environment.

Communication technologies such as messaging applications, video conferencing tools, discussion boards, and learning management systems (LMS) can increase learner engagement. Students can use break-out rooms on the Zoom platform, for example, to work in groups. They can also join interactive games on Kahoot!. Students can also get materials and projects from their school's LMS.

A key benefit of distance learning is flexibility. This helps students adapt learning to their personal schedules as well as location. When COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic in March 2020, a shift to distance learning became necessary due to school closures. Students did not need to commute from home to school. They could continue participating in class without being tied to a specific location. The availability of distance learning has added to its increasing popularity in education.
