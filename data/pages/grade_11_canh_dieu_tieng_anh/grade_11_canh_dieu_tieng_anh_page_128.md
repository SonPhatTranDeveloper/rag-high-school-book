1. 

In our daily lives, we generally know what we're going to do, where to go, and who to ask if we need something. We're in our comfort zone; we're comfortable. When we travel to a different country, where people might speak a different language, we leave our comfort zone, and sometimes that can be frightening. But it's worth it! Challenges help us grow and become more confident.

2. 

Changes in location and breaks from our routine make us feel better. We are stimulated by seeing new places and experiencing new cultures. Also, when we travel, we are often more active, so we do more exercise, even if it is only walking around a new city sightseeing. Traveling can be very motivating, so it is good for your mind and your body.

3. 

There are a lot of problems in our world that will cause bigger problems in the future if we don't find solutions. With climate change, pollution, and other environmental issues in front of us, we need to work together as citizens of the world. When you travel, you meet new people, make new connections, and understand the world better. This helps you become a global citizen.

4. 

When we travel, we can visit museums, art galleries, and festivals, as well as restaurants, cafes, and markets. All these things help us learn about the history and culture of a country and help us understand that people around the world think differently and do things differently. When we travel, we learn about a country, its culture, and its people, and we come home with new understanding. This opens your mind and can help you respect others and see your own culture more clearly.
