WRITING SKILLS: Using Supporting Details

A good topic sentence gives the main idea of a paragraph. In addition, a good paragraph includes details to support, or give more information about the main idea.

Some types of supporting details:
descriptions       examples       explanations       facts       reasons

D Underline the topic sentence in the following paragraph. Then answer the questions below.

Although there are several ways to prevent the spread of disease, staying home when you are sick may be the best way. First, when you stay home, the germs in your body are kept in your own room or home only. Therefore, no one at school or at work has contact with your germs. It is also easier to clean your home of the germs than a public place. Moreover, when you are sick, covering your mouth when you cough at the school or workplace may be less effective than staying at home. Some of your germs are still sent into the air when you talk and breathe. Finally, washing your hands after every cough or sneeze may be the least effective way to keep other people healthy. Even with a portable hand sanitizer, it may not be possible to clean your hands that many times in a day and you may also be distracted a lot in doing so.
