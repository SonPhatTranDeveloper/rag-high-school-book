WRITING SKILLS: An Effective Opinion Paragraph

1. Begin with a strong topic sentence that clearly states your point of view.
2. Support your opinion by giving good, logical reasons for it.
3. End with a brief conclusion related to the opinion and reasons you gave.

Read the passage about holiday customs. What is the author's opinion?

Old holiday customs are an important connection to our present and past culture, so we should not forget them. A culture is built upon a lot of values, beliefs, and practices. The customs, especially those shown in holidays and celebrations, are often the easiest parts to see in a culture. They form parts of our identities and help to distinguish one community from another. Therefore, practicing these customs is an easy way to let others know who we are. Moreover, the old customs also provide a connection between different generations. In today's busy world, members of a family may only gather during a holiday or a celebration. Then, during the preparation and practice of the old customs, we may see the older members explaining to the younger ones the meaning of the customs and the steps involved. In so doing, they not only pass on the traditional knowledge and beliefs within the customs but also strengthen the connections between the old and the young. That is why it is important to remember and practice old customs.

Look at the Writing Skills box again. Identify the parts of the opinion passage in F.

1. Circle the topic sentence.
2. Underline the supporting reasons. How many reasons does the author give to support her opinion?
3. Circle the conclusion.

Choose one of the statements from C. What is your opinion about it? Brainstorm ideas and complete the visual map with ideas for each part of the passage.

[A visual map with three sections labeled "Topic sentence", "Supporting reasons", and "Conclusion" is shown, but left blank for the reader to fill in.]
