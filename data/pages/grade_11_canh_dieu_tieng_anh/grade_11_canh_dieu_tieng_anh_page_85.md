A GOAL Discuss Spending Habits

Vocabulary

A Read the article.

Life is full of choices. Should you buy the latest smartphone, or put your money in a savings account instead? Do you really need that phone, or is it a luxury you can live without? These are questions that are asked every day, and for many people, the answer is to reduce the amount of money they spend in order to increase their happiness.

If you believe the TV commercials, the journey to a satisfying life is made in a beautiful new car. Owning nice things is supposed to produce good feelings in people. Now, though, more people are deciding not to waste their money on a new car when they can easily take the bus or drive an older car. Instead of doing things the usual way—working too much and enjoying life too little—they are choosing to focus on the quality of their lives. They're spending more time doing the things they love and less money buying things they don't need.
