Communication

Read the information. What does sustainable mean?

Fish is one of the world's favorite foods. Around the world, the average person eats 36 pounds (16 kg) of fish every year. But many kinds of fish around the world are disappearing because people catch too many of them. Scientists say that 90 percent of the biggest fish are gone now. If we catch too many big fish now, there won't be any baby fish in the future. Some species of fish will become extinct. Our way of fishing now is not sustainableâ€”if it continues, it will hurt the environment.

GOAL CHECK Discuss Ways to Solve Future Problems

In groups, discuss ways to solve fishing problems.

1. Read each plan. What will happen if we follow each one? Write some notes.

Plan A: Don't eat fish! Tell people to stop buying and eating too many young fish. Put ads in newspapers and magazines, and make TV commercials to explain why fishing hurts the environment.

Plan B: Safe fish symbol Make a special symbol for fish that are caught in a sustainable way. Make commercials to tell people to look for this symbol in supermarkets and restaurants.

Plan C: Strict laws about fishing Make stronger laws about how many fish people can catch. Send special police in fast boats to all of the fishing areas to make sure that fishing boats follow the laws.

2. Discuss the plans with your group.

3. As a group, decide which is the best plan.

4. Explain your decision to the class.
