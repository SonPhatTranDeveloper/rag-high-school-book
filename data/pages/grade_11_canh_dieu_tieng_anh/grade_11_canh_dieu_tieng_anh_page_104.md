so that fishing can be sustainable. He believes that protecting the ocean is everybody's job. "Take your responsibilities with courage and never think that you are alone. We are all in this together."

In Florida, in the US, the Sea Turtle Conservancy (STC) organization noticed that there were always a lot of single-use plastic items, like coffee stirrers, bottles, and drinking straws, on the beaches. All of these items can hurt the ocean wildlife terribly. Straws are especially dangerous for turtles: they can get stuck in turtles' noses and hurt them very badly. So, the STC started the project "Where are the straws?" asking local restaurants to stop giving customers straws with their drinks. Now, many restaurants will only give straws if customers ask for them, and the straws they do give out are paper, not plastic.

These are just two of the many conservation efforts found all over the world today. These projects all show us that change is possible and that it can start with small actions in our own community. We are part of the problem. It's time to be part of the solution.
