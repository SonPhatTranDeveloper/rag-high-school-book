Today, many people travel from one country to another easily, but long-distance travel used to be very challenging hundreds of years ago. Still, there were always people who wanted to discover new places. Explorers used to travel on trips that often took many years, and the result was an exchange of knowledge and culture that changed the world.

Marco Polo (1254-1324) was one of these great explorers. He lived in Venice and Genoa, in what is now Italy. In 1271, at about 17, he set off on a trip with his father and uncle and traveled eastâ€”far beyond the borders of Europe, into Asia.

Marco's father was a merchant searching for opportunities for trade with China. They traveled first by ship, then by horse and camel, through many countries. Everything was very different: they saw amazing places and learned new things. In China, for example, they were surprised to see paper money, eyeglasses, the compass, and silk making.

Marco Polo returned to Italy 24 years later with lots of experiences to share. But he only became famous after his book, The Description of the World, was published. The book inspired other world travelers centuries later.
