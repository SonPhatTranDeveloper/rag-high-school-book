Real Conditionals in the Future

We use the real conditional for situations that can happen in the future.

If the world gets hotter, the Arctic ice will melt. The Arctic ice will melt if the world gets hotter.

Conditional sentences have two parts: the condition and the result. The condition or the result can be first in the sentence.

If the world gets hotter, the ice is going to melt. The ice is going to melt if the world gets hotter.

F Read the text in B again and underline the conditional sentences.

G Complete the sentences with the correct form of the verbs in parentheses.

1. Polar bears _________________________ (lose) their habitat if the sea ice _________________________ (melt).

2. If we _________________________ (take) action now, we _________________________ (help) protect nature.

3. If the temperature _________________________ (get) higher, more wild animals _________________________ (be) endangered.

4. Polar bears _________________________ (try) to find food in towns if they _________________________ (have to) live on land.

5. If humans _________________________ (not control) climate change, more species _________________________ (become) extinct.

H Discuss these situations in pairs. Write sentences to describe them in your notebook. What will happen if...

1. the climate continues to change?
2. the polar bears' habitat disappears?
3. polar bears can't catch enough seals?
4. people protect polar bears?
5. polar bears become extinct?
6. polar bears try to find food in towns?
