2. What will they do after they check in at the hotel?
3. What will they do after they walk to Plaza Bolivar?
4. What will they do before they eat dinner at a restaurant?
5. What will they do before they leave Bogotá?

After arriving in Bogotá, they will take a taxi to their hotel and check in.

• Monday: Arrive in Bogotá, Colombia at 1:15 p.m.
• Take a taxi to the hotel; check in.
• Walk to the Plaza Bolivar; take pictures.
• Visit the Botero art museum.
• Eat dinner at a restaurant.

D. Combine the sentences using the present participle or the present perfect participle.

1. Sofia lives in a suburb. She enjoys the quiet neighborhood.
2. Sofia will visit the city next Saturday. She will go to the new shopping center with Hana.
3. Hana has finished her class. She is going to have lunch with Sofia.
4. Hana has completed her project. She can visit Sofia in the suburbs.

E. Read the summary of Sofia's situation. Rewrite the summary using present participle clauses when possible.

As Sofia lives in a suburb outside the city, she can enjoy the quiet neighborhoods and many green spaces, such as parks and gardens. On the other hand, because Sofia enjoys visiting her friend in the city, she is thinking about moving downtown. She has not made up her mind yet.

Conversation (Optional)

F. Close your book and listen to the conversation. Where does each speaker live?

Sofia: What a great day it's been!
Hana: I agree! When will you come downtown to visit me again?
Sofia: Maybe I'll come next Saturday. I want to see the new shopping center.
Hana: That sounds good, but I have my yoga-in-the-park class on Saturday mornings.
Sofia: Will you be free after you finish class?
Hana: Yes. We could have lunch before we go to the shopping center.
Sofia: Great! It sounds like another perfect day in the city.
Hana: And maybe I can visit you in the suburbs soon.

G. Replace the time clauses in the conversation with present participles if possible. Then practice the conversation in pairs.
