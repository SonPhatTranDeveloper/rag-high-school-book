Lesson A

The Simple Present vs. The Present Continuous; Stative Verbs

Use the simple present to talk about habits and things that are generally true.

I almost never buy fruit at the supermarket.
My father usually goes to the farmers' market.

Use the present continuous to talk about actions and events that are happening now. Note that you can use contractions.

We are making a healthy dinner today.
I'm preparing a salad with lots of fresh vegetables.

Form the present continuous with the correct form of be (not) + the -ing form of the verb.

My dad is making lunch.
He is not making breakfast.

Yes / No Questions:

Simple present: Do / Does + subject + base form of the verb

Does she eat meat?
Yes, she does.
Are you ready to have breakfast? Yes, I am.

Present continuous: correct form of be + subject + verb + -ing

Is he making a cake?
Are they eating?

Wh- Questions:

Simple present: Wh- question word + do / does + subject + base form of the verb

What do you eat on special occasions?

Present continuous: Wh- question word + correct form of be + subject + verb + -ing

What are you making?

Stative verbs (think, taste, have, smell...)

Stative verbs express a state rather than an action, so they are not usually used in continuous tenses.

I think that coffee is great. (a state)
The coffee tastes really bitter. (a state)

When used in the continuous tenses, these verbs express different meanings.

I am thinking about Jane's birthday party last night. (an action)
The chef is tasting the chicken soup. (an action)

A Circle the correct form.

1. Do you buy / Are you buying the ingredients for the dish right now?
2. We always eat pozole / are eating pozole on special occasions.

3. I almost never drink / am drinking coffee.
4. Is dad making / Does dad make a cake because it's my birthday today?
5. We don't usually go / aren't usually going out for dinner.
6. I have / am having a wonderful dinner at my friend's house.

B Write the correct form of the verb in parentheses.

1. Lila never _____________ meat or fish. She's a vegetarian. (eat)
2. What _____________? (you make) It _____________ good! (smell)
3. I never _____________ my cell phone when I'm at the table with my family. (use)
4. My little brother _____________ to try new foods. (not like)
5. Right now, I _____________ how to make curry. My aunt _____________ me. (learn; teach)
6. Wait a minute! I _____________. (think)

1. How often do you go out for dinner?

2. Do you usually cook the meals in your house?

Lesson C

The Simple Past

Use the simple past to talk about completed past actions or situations.

We walked to the restaurant last night.
The meal was delicious.

Many verbs are regular in the simple past. They have an -ed ending.

walk – walked
prepare – prepared
watch – watched
plan – planned
stop – stopped
carry – carried

For regular verbs ending in -y, change y to i, then add -ed.
For a regular verb that ends in a single vowel and a single consonant, double the consonant, then add -ed.
