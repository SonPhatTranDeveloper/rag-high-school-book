Climate Change

Polar bears live on the Arctic sea ice. It is their natural habitat. From these ice platforms, they can catch seals to eat. The ice is very important for polar bears, but sadly it is disappearing because of climate change. The world is getting warmer and the Arctic ice is melting. If the ice disappears, polar bears will have a hard time finding food.

If we don't try to stop climate change, polar bears and other wild animals are going to become extinct. We need to protect these endangered species. They are all an important part of the natural world.
