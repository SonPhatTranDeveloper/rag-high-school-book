## Writing

### WRITING SKILLS: Topic Sentences

Most paragraphs in English begin with a topic sentence. The topic sentence tells us:

1. the main idea (What is the topic of the paragraph?)
2. the controlling idea (What does the paragraph say about the topic?)

A good topic sentence helps the reader understand your ideas.
