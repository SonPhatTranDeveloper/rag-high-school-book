The Evolution of Distance Learning

Distance learning is not a new approach to instruction and learning. In fact, correspondence courses, which are the oldest form of distance learning, have been used for over 150 years. Thanks to the development of technology, distance no longer poses a problem to learning. Students can study anywhere they want without having to be present in the class at all times, which allows them to combine their studies with work or family life.
