## Communication

Hawaii's Lantern Floating Festival

People travel from all over the world to participate in Hawaii's Lantern Floating Festival. Lantern Floating Festival is a ceremony to remember family and friends who have died. It takes place on Memorial Day, the last Monday in May. The festival begins with music and singing, and then, as the sun sets, everyone lights their lanterns. Each lantern has a message written on it, and sometimes people also attach photos of their loved ones to them. Once they are lit, the lanterns are released onto the water. It is a truly beautiful sight. Lantern Floating is a moment to remember and give thanks to the people who have left the world before us.
