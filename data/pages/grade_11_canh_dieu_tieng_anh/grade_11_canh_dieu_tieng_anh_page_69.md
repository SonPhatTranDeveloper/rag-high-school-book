WRITING SKILLS: Using Specific Information and Conjunctions

When you describe something in writing, specific information helps your reader imagine and understand your ideas. The more interesting your details are, the more your writing will engage your reader. Specific information might include:
• dates or times • descriptions • locations • people's reactions
• step-by-step actions

Besides subordinating conjunctions like when and while, you could also use many other conjunctions to join words, phrases, or clauses in a sentence. Examples of conjunctions in writing are and, or, but, because, although, so, and after. Conjunctions can be used to give more information, alternatives, reasons, results, or unexpected information.

Hi,

How are you and your family? I hope you're doing well. I'm also fine here. Let me tell you about a challenging experience I've had recently.

You know, I just got a part-time job as a babysitter. On Saturday afternoon, Adam, the first kid I babysit, got bored quickly. First, he complained about the food, the milk, and the toys I gave him... After he complained about everything, he cried loudly for several minutes. I felt nervous because he was very noisy. Although I didn't know how to deal with a bored five-year-old boy at first, I thought I should do something. So, I had an idea. I went into the kitchen and came back with a big bowl of apples, pears, and bananas. When Adam saw the fruits, he looked surprised and stopped crying! That's how I managed to overcome the first challenge in my part-time job.

What about you? Have you had any challenging experiences? Write back and let me know.

Love,
Jane
