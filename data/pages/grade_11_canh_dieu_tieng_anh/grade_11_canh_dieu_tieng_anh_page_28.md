# Communication

## Read the text.

English speakers often make small talk when they meet someone new. In general, small talk should make people feel more comfortable—not less comfortable—so the topics should not be very personal. For example, "Which department do you work in?" is a good question at work, but "How much money do you make?" is too personal.

## Circle the topics that are good for small talk when you meet someone for the first time. Then add two more ideas. Compare your ideas in pairs.

family    money    religion    school    sports    work    _______    _______

## In pairs, read the situations. Choose a question to ask for each situation. Then, write and practice brief conversations based on the situations.

### Situation 1
Min-Hee talks to Judy. It's Judy's first day at this job.
a. Are you new in this city?    b. Are you making a good salary here?

### Situation 2
Andrei is from Russia. He talks to Eduardo at the International Students' Club. It's Eduardo's first meeting.
a. Where are you from?    b. Do you practice a religion?

### Situation 3
Mark lives in apartment 104. He meets his new neighbor Lisa in the apartment building.
a. Do you like living here?    b. Are you married?

### Situation 4
Liz is making small talk with another student in her class.
a. What was your grade on the test?    b. Did you think the test was difficult?

## With your partner, discuss the "incorrect" answers from H.
Why do you think those questions might make someone feel uncomfortable? Do you think it's the same in Vietnamese culture?

# GOAL CHECK

## Make Small Talk with New People

1. In pairs, write four good questions to ask when you meet someone new in the following situations:
   - Situation 1: You are a new student in the class. You don't know anybody here.
   - Situation 2: You are at the bus stop. Your bus will arrive in 10 minutes.
   - Situation 3: You are waiting in line to buy movie tickets at a cinema.

2. Join another pair and ask and answer your questions. Are all of the questions good for making small talk?
