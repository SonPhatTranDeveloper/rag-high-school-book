D Read the text about a festival. Underline the topic sentence and the last sentence.

Lim Festival

Around mid-January of the lunar calendar every year, thousands of people from the north of Viet Nam travel to Bac Ninh. They travel there to participate in the Lim Festival, a cultural event that dates back more than 300 years. The celebration usually starts with a parade where villagers are dressed in colorful traditional costumes. Then, many rituals take place to worship Gods and to honor the founders of the festival. In the main part of the festival, people hold many folk games such as wrestling, chess, weaving competitions, and rice cooking competitions. However, the most important activity is the art of "Quan Ho" singing, which was recognized as an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in 2009. Male and female singers in traditional costumes challenge each other by singing a song, in which each partner must sing different lyrics to match their partner's melody. So, if you like travel, art, and unusual experiences, you should visit Bac Ninh next spring!

E Use your notes from B to write a paragraph (150-180 words) for a travel blog. In your blog, you want to encourage people to visit your country for a cultural event. Use the text in D to help you.

F Exchange paragraphs with a partner. How can your partner improve his or her paragraph? Write notes on the paragraph. Use your partner's comments to make corrections and improvements.
