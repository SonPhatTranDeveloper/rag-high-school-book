Conversation (Optional)

Close your book and listen to the conversation. What does Lisa need to do before she can climb the mountain?

Lisa: Do you know what I want to do next summer? My goal is to climb Black Mountain.
Mari: Are you serious? Black Mountain is too hard to climb. Don't you need special equipment?
Lisa: I already asked about it. I just need good boots.
Mari: And you're not strong enough to climb a mountain!
Lisa: You're right, I can't do it now. But I'll go hiking every weekend. Next summer, I'll be fit enough to climb the mountain.
Mari: Well, I like hiking. I'll go with you sometimes!
