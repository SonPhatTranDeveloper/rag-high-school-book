Conversation (Optional)

Listen to the conversation with your book closed. What time will the traveler get on the plane?

Airline agent: Good afternoon. Where are you flying to today?
Traveler: To Bogot√°. Here's my passport.
Airline agent: Thank you. And do you have any bags to check?
Traveler: Just one. And this is my carry-on bag.
Airline agent: OK, thank you. Here's your boarding pass. You're in seat 27D. Boarding time is 10:15 at gate 13, but you must be at the gate 30 minutes before that.
Traveler: OK, and 27D is a window seat, isn't it?
Airline agent: No, I'm afraid it isn't. There aren't any window seats available.
Traveler: Oh, I thought I had reserved a window seat when I booked online.
Airline agent: I'm sorry about that, ma'am. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Traveler: Yes, is there a restaurant after the security check?
Airline agent: Yes, there are two.

In pairs, practice the conversation. Switch roles and practice it again.

GOAL CHECK Use English at the Airport

1. In pairs, write a list of the things you do at an airport.
2. Join another pair and compare your lists. Put the actions in order.
3. Prepare the dialog for a how-to video in which you show other students how to use English at the airport.

Barajas International Airport in Madrid, Spain

SPEAKING STRATEGY
Notice the traveler's question: 27D is a window seat, isn't it? Use these tag questions (short questions at the end of a sentence, after a comma) to confirm information.
