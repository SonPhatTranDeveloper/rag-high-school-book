TIENG ANH 11
EXPLORE NEW WORLDS

This appears to be the cover or title page of an English language textbook for Vietnamese students. The main title "TIENG ANH 11" is prominently displayed, followed by the English subtitle "EXPLORE NEW WORLDS".

The book is part of a series, as indicated by the number 11. It is likely aimed at 11th grade students or those at an equivalent English proficiency level.

At the bottom of the page, there are logos of the publishing organizations involved:
- A logo that appears to be for a Vietnamese educational publisher
- VEPIC logo
- National Geographic Learning logo

The cover design is simple and clean, with the title in large black text against a white background. There is a faint circular graphic element in the center of the page.

This textbook seems to be officially approved for use in the Vietnamese education system, as indicated by some Vietnamese text below the subtitle (which I will not translate as per instructions).
