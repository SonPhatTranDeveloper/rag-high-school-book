Read the information about the New Seven Wonders of the World.

What does it mean to be a "wonder of the world"? Both the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the New Seven Wonders are examples of humankind's greatest achievements. They include historical sites that show the incredible things we are capable of creating. Of the original Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid in Giza, Egypt, still exists, so Swiss-Canadian filmmaker and adventurer Bernard Weber started the New Seven Wonders of the World project. He wanted the greatest achievements of the last 2,000 years to be recognized now and remembered in the future. He also wanted regular people to decide on these new wonders by voting over the phone and internet. The project began in the year 2000, and the results were announced in 2007 with nearly 100 million votes. The new wonders include the Great Wall of China, the Colosseum in Rome, and the Taj Mahal in India.
