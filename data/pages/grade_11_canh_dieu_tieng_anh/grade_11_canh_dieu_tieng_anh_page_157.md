Lesson C

Present Participles vs. Present Perfect Participles

The present participle is the -ing form of a verb. It has an active meaning.

I'll move to the city after graduating from university.

The present perfect participle is formed as having + past participle.

Having found a job in the city, I started looking for an apartment.

The present participle can be used in a present participle clause, with the same subject of the verb in the main clause.

When moving (= When you move) to the city, will you rent an apartment?
Walking (= When you walk) around the city center you will see many shopping centers.
