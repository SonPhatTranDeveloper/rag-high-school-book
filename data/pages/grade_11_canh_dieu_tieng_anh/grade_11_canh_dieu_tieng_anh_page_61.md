| I absolutely love challenges! Doing something difficult makes me feel alive. Recently, I set a goal for myself: To run a marathon and make it to the finish line. I trained almost every day before the marathon, and I felt like I was making progress toward my goal. Last month, I achieved the goal with a competitive time! | Although it might not seem like a significant challenge to some people, reading is quite difficult for me, especially when I need to do a lot of it. Last year, I convinced my parents to hire a reading tutor to help me. I learned ways to deal with large amounts of reading homework, and I hope the result will be better grades this year. |
