Modern supermarkets give us many choices. There are colorful fruits and vegetables, fresh fish and meat, many kinds of bread, eggs, yogurt, and cheese. But at the same time, people in the modern world are experiencing health problems. Could the food we eat be causing some of these problems?

One explanation for modern health problems is that they began when human beings became farmers about 12,000 years ago. Around that time, people started growing and eating crops, such as wheat and rice. Some people believe that returning to an earlier way of eating—a "paleo diet" that includes only meat, fish, and fruits and vegetables—might be a solution to our modern health problems.

A paleo diet is special because it doesn't include grains, dairy foods, or legumes, such as peanuts or beans. For many of us, it is not possible to prepare our favorite dishes without these ingredients. But people who follow a paleo diet only eat foods people ate before farming began. They believe this is a more natural and healthier way to eat.

For Dr. Peter Ungar, the truth is not so simple. In human history, people have eaten a wide variety of foods. Early human beings lived in different places with different climates, so many kinds of food were available to our ancestors even before farming began. Dr. Ungar says our ability to eat in many different ways and to be healthy whether we live in the Arctic or in the tropics is the important thing. One thing is certain, though: If you do decide to try a paleo diet, remember that your meals might actually have less variety than the meals of your early ancestors.
