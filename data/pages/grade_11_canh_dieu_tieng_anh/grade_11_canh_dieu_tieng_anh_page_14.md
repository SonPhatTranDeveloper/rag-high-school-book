# The Simple Present vs. The Present Continuous; Stative Verbs

| Use the simple present to talk about habits and things that are generally true. | Fresh vegetables are always available at the market.
I normally don't eat eggs for breakfast.

|---|---|
| Use the present continuous to talk about actions and events that are happening now. | I am watching and learning how to make the cake.
My father isn't preparing a special dish for tonight's dinner.
Is she celebrating her birthday now? |
| Stative verbs (think, taste, have, smell...)
express a state rather than an action, so they are not usually used in continuous tenses.
When used in the continuous tenses, these verbs express the meaning of an action | I think that coffee is great. (a state)
The coffee tastes really bitter. (a state)
I am thinking about Jane's birthday party last night. (an action)
The chef is tasting the chicken soup. (an action) |
