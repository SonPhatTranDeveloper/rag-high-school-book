Dear Sir or Madam,

Paragraph 1:
I am writing to apply for a volunteer position at the local centre for community development. I heard about this opportunity in a public announcement last Monday.

Paragraph 2:
I am interested in your community development projects because I really care about the life of people in the community and want to offer my services to you. Currently, all my Sunday afternoons are free, and I will be able to help at the centre if I am chosen.

Paragraph 3:
I have already filled in the online application form and sent it in as requested. I am available for an interview on any weekday after 4.30 p.m. or at weekends. If my application is successful, I can start immediately.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,
Nguyen Ha Vi
