Grammar
Reported speech

Remember!

We use reported speech when we want to tell someone what we or someone else said before.

When we use reported speech, we change personal pronouns, tenses of verbs, and adverbs of time.

Example:
'I will fly to Ho Chi Minh City tomorrow,' Nam said.
→ Nam said he would fly to Ho Chi Minh City the following day.

When reporting questions, we often use the verb ask and the word order for statements, and omit the question mark.

- Wh-questions:
Example:
'Where do you live?'
→ He asked me where I lived.

- Yes/No questions:
Example:
'Do you like the book?'
→ He asked me if I liked the book.
