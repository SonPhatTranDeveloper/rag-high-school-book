MODERN SCHOOLS

Modern schools are designed to help each student to be successful. Teachers play the role of a guide for them and prepare them for lifelong learning. They encourage and challenge them to become responsible and confident individuals.

Class discussion is a main feature of modern schools. Students are expected to take part in discussions and express personal opinions. It is also important to ask questions in class if students do not understand any point or instruction. Group learning is another common feature. Students may work in small groups on a project task.

In class, teachers and students use computers to access digital learning resources. Teachers use technology and audio-visual materials to support their lessons. Outside the classroom, students have a chance to participate in field trips to famous landmarks such as museums, hospitals, and industry locations. These trips give them real-world experiences. Students also attend school camps to make friends with other students and to develop life skills in unfamiliar environments.

1. What is the role of teachers in modern schools?
2. What are two common features of modern schools?
3. How do students use computers in the learning process?
