GENDER EQUALITY IN SPORTS

In the Pacific Island of Fiji, a new sport programme enables both male and female school teachers to receive training as coaches. Rugby, which is often considered a male sport, is creating more opportunities for men and women in Fiji. For Kitiana Kaitu, a primary school teacher from Nasinu, Fiji, it was an honour to become a rugby coach. She has recently qualified as a coach and life skills trainer for this sport programme.

Sport can be used as a powerful tool to reject gender roles and build a healthy lifestyle. In the Pacific region, rugby is a particularly important sport. Kitiana Kaitu is now one of the highly skilled coaches who are discovering new ways to encourage both girls and boys in Fiji to play rugby.
