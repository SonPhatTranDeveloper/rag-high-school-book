Inventions for education

1 Listen and read.

Phong: Dad, I've saved some money since Tet holiday. I think I'll buy something new for my studies.
Dad: Good idea, Phong. What do you want to buy?
Phong: I'm not sure. It's hard to choose between a smartphone and a laptop. They're both useful and I've wanted either of them for a long time. What do you think, Dad?
Dad: Perhaps a laptop is a better choice. Since laptops were invented, they've allowed us to study better and work faster. They've completely changed our lives in the last 20 years.
Phong: That's true, Dad. But smartphones have also improved the way we work and study.
Dad: Really? I didn't know smartphones were suitable for learning.
Phong: Well, it's actually a lot of fun to learn with educational apps. It's also very convenient for learners to use them. Some of my classmates love using them on their smartphones. The apps allow them to communicate and learn at the same time.
Dad: I didn't know that! There have been so many valuable inventions. Hmm... Perhaps you should ask your teacher. She may be able to help you decide.
