Hi Dong,

How are you getting on? In your last email you asked me about my family routines. Well, we have quite a few routines to help us learn life skills and build family bonds, but I'll tell you about three main ones.

First, my family always have dinner together. Dinners are important for us since we share our daily experiences and talk about the latest news. Second, we watch our favourite game show on TV together every Friday evening. We discuss the questions and guess the answers. It's great fun every time we get a correct answer. Third, every two weeks, on Saturday we clean the house together. We make a list of all the chores. Each of us then chooses one or two household tasks according to personal choice. We all feel happy and proud when we see our home spotlessly clean at the end of the day.

Do you have similar family routines? I'd be interested to know about your family.
Please write back soon.

Best,
Joey
