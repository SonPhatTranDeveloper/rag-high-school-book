Gender equality has been greatly promoted around the world. However, there are still many challenges that women face.

First of all, there are still girls who are forced to get married before the age of 18. In many places, parents may see child marriage as a way to protect their daughters from violence. However, many of these young girls become victims of domestic violence. Child marriage also carries serious health risks as young girls are not physically developed to give birth.

Secondly, more than half of the world's uneducated people are women. This means fewer girls than boys go to school or stay long at school. Girls who receive an education are less likely to marry young. They can also have better job skills and can earn higher salaries. Education gives girls the opportunity to have a better life and give back to their communities.

Thirdly, women are often paid less than men. In other words, women have to work longer than men to earn the same amount of money. Differences in career choices might be one reason. Women tend to become nurses, secretaries, or shop assistants, which are low-paying jobs, while men choose high-paying careers as surgeons, airline pilots, or engineers.

Women are still not equal to men in today's society, and governments, organisations and individuals must work together to achieve gender equality.
