Grammar
Present simple vs. present continuous

Remember!
- We use the present simple to talk about habits or things we do regularly.
Example: My mother cooks every day.
- We use the present continuous to talk about things which are happening at the moment of speaking.
Example: My mother isn't cooking now. She's working in her office.
Note: We don't usually use the present continuous tense with stative verbs (like, love, need, want, know, agree, etc.).
