# 10 Ecotourism

## I GETTING STARTED

An eco-friendly fieldtrip to Phong Nha Cave

1 Listen and read.

**Ms Hoa:** Listen, everyone! This year, we're going on a fieldtrip to Phong Nha Cave, a tourist attraction in Quang Binh Province.

**Class:** Hooray!

**Nam:** I hope I can find some small pieces of stalactites. If I add some to my rock collection, it will be the best at school.

**Mai:** I'll buy a lot of snacks to share. We'll have fun!

**Ms Hoa:** We will have fun, but in a different way. This time, the fieldtrip is going to be eco-friendly.

**Nam:** Ms Hoa, what's an eco-friendly fieldtrip?

**Ms Hoa:** Going on an eco-friendly fieldtrip means we'll enjoy, explore and learn about the place, but in a way that will not damage it. So, Nam, I'm afraid you can't take any stalactites because it takes hundreds or sometimes thousands of years for them to form.

**Nam:** Wow! I didn't know that. I won't even touch them, I promise.

**Mai:** But can we bring snacks?
