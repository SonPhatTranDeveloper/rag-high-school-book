PROJECT
Doing a survey on students' future jobs

At an international summer camp: Lan is talking with Mark and Linda about jobs.

Lan: It's great to have another week full of activities and trips at the camp.

Mark: Oh, yeah. I like the trip to the kindergarten most. The kids were adorable and the teachers were great. I think I'll be a kindergarten teacher.

Lan: That's fantastic. My cousin works at a kindergarten and the children love being in his class. By the way, what do you want to be in the future, Linda?

Linda: Oh, I've always wanted to be a surgeon, so I'll go to medical school. What about you, Lan?

Lan: Me? My dream is to become an airline pilot. That's why I'm focusing on maths and physics, and exercising more to improve my fitness.

Linda: Cool! I hope your dream will come true. In some countries girls may not be allowed to be pilots.

Lan: That's true, Linda. We're lucky to live in a country where boys and girls are encouraged to do the jobs they want.

Mark: I couldn't agree more. Girls mustn't be kept home in today's world. Boys and girls should be treated equally and given the same job opportunities.
