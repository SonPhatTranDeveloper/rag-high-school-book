A. The writer's secondary school has a long and interesting history.
B. The Volunteer Club was set up 15 years ago to help teens gain work experience.
C. The club organises many volunteering activities that benefit both the community and the students.

I joined the Volunteer Club when I started secondary school. The club was formed fifteen years ago, shortly after the school was set up. Since then, it has organised various volunteering activities for all students to participate.

One of the most popular activities of our club is selling handmade items to raise money for the local orphanage and homeless old people. Last year, we also raised over one hundred million VND to help people in flooded areas. The money was used to buy warm clothes, blankets, food, and clean water.

Our club welcomes different types of donations: clothes, picture books, unused notebooks, and other unwanted items. At the end of each month, we take the donations to the community centre. Our club also organises afterschool games for the children at the orphanage and concerts for the old people at the centre. In addition, it offers other volunteering activities, such as helping at a food bank or delivering free meals to poor families.

Volunteering has helped me gain life experiences and find my sense of purpose in life. When I see suffering and hardships, I feel thankful for what I have. What is more, these activities provide opportunities for me to meet other teenagers with similar interests and help me build essential life skills.
