## I GETTING STARTED

### Volunteering in the community

1. Listen and read.

**Kim:** Hi, Tam. I went to your house at 9 a.m., but you weren't there.

**Tam:** Oh, when you came, I was working as a volunteer at our local centre for community development.

**Kim:** Ah, I see. How did you become a volunteer there?

**Tam:** Just by chance. Last summer, while I was visiting the centre, I saw an advertisement for volunteers. I applied and my application was successful.

**Kim:** I also want to be a volunteer. I find community work very interesting.

**Tam:** I agree. Community service not only benefits the local area, but can also boost our confidence and help us learn many useful skills.

**Kim:** What are the regular activities organised by the centre?

**Tam:** Oh, there are endless opportunities for getting involved. For example, you can join a local environmental group to clean up the park once a week or volunteer at an orphanage.

**Kim:** Sounds good. How can I apply?

**Tam:** I'll email you the form. You just fill it in and send it in.

**Kim:** Thanks so much. I'm so excited about volunteering at the centre.

**Tam:** No problem. Good luck. Hope your application is successful and you enjoy the work.
