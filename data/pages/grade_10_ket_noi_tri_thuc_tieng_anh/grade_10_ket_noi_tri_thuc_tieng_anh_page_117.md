Environmental Impact of Tourism

Although tourism is often called 'the smokeless industry', or an environmentally-friendly industry, it can actually damage nature. However, different kinds of tourism may have different effects on the environment.

• Mass tourism is a kind of tourism which involves tens of thousands of people crowding the same places at the same time of year. It often has a lot of negative impact on the local area, such as litter from tourists and pollution from traffic.

• Ecotourism provides tourists with opportunities to explore nature, and at the same time helps protect the environment and educates travellers on local environmental issues. It also promotes tourists' respect for local communities.

• Sustainable tourism involves not only environmental protection and cultural respect, but also efforts to keep profits local. It often refers to actions of the tourist industry as a whole.

• Responsible tourism encourages tourists to be more than visitors. Responsible tourists should not only be aware of their role, but also take part in protecting the environment, culture and improving the profits for local people. Responsible tourism often relates to specific actions of individuals, businesses and communities.
