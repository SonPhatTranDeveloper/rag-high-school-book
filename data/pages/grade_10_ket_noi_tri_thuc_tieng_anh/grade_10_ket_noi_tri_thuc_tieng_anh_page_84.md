FAO AND ITS ACTIVITIES IN VIET NAM

The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations was formed in 1945. Its main aim is to end hunger and poverty by making sure all people have access to healthy food. It hopes to raise the levels of nutrition and the standard of living in its member countries. It also tries to improve the production of food and agricultural products, and make sure they reach all groups of society.

FAO started working in Viet Nam in 1978. Since then, it has provided Viet Nam with technical support and advice to the government in the field of agriculture. It has also helped Viet Nam carry out hundreds of projects in different areas.

In response to FAO's support, Viet Nam has actively participated in FAO activities, including food security and nutrition. Food security means that all people have access to enough and safe food while good nutrition or getting the right type of food is essential for normal growth and development.
