Nam's father: You should focus on each problem, explain the main causes of it, and then suggest the solutions.

Nam: Thanks, Dad. But presenting all the solutions will be hard.

Nam's father: Have you asked your teacher for advice?

Nam: Yes, I have. She advised me to start with small, practical actions to protect the environment before coming up with big ideas that need a lot of effort or money to succeed.

Nam's father: Sounds good. You'd better follow her advice. When did she ask you to present it?

Nam: She said I should present it the following week.

Nam's father: You still have a lot of time. Good luck!

Nam: Thanks, Dad.
