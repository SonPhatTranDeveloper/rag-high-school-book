The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), originally called the World Wildlife Fund, is a non-governmental organisation. It was set up in 1961, and today it is the world's largest environmental organisation. It aims to stop the process of destroying the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans respect nature.

Much of the work of WWF focuses on the survival of endangered animals and the protection of their natural habitats. These animals include the Indian elephant, the gorilla, the giant tortoise and the giant panda. Currently, WWF has 5 million supporters worldwide. It works in more than 100 countries and supports around 1,300 environmental projects.
