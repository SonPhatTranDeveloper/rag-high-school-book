CARBON FOOTPRINT

A carbon footprint is the total amount of CO2 produced by human activities. It also includes the emissions of other greenhouse gases. Although calculating your carbon footprint can be difficult, you can still estimate it based on how big your family is, how much electricity your appliances use, how much you drive or fly, or how much you recycle.

Globally, the average carbon footprint per person is more than 4 tons per year. Too much CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere can cause serious problems. It can lead to increasing global temperatures and air pollution, and destroy the natural world.

It's not difficult to reduce your carbon footprint. You can do it by making your daily activities eco-friendly. For example, you can take shorter showers. The less hot water you use, the less energy is needed to heat the water. Instead of using your personal car or motorbike, you should use public transport, walk or cycle as much as possible.

These simple activities can help reduce your carbon footprint and your impact on the environment.
