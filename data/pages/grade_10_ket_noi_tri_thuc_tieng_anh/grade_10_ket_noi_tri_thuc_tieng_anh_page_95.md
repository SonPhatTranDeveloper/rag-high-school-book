PROJECT

TECHNOLOGY FOR LEARNING

Work in groups. Do a survey to find out how students in your school use electronic devices to learn. Try to find at least 15 students to interview. Ask about the following:
• names of students using electronic devices in learning
• types of electronic devices (e.g. desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones)
• how often they use them (e.g. every day, twice a week)
• purposes for using them (e.g. to read articles, to use educational apps, to take online courses)

Names | Devices | Frequency | Purposes
-------|---------|-----------|----------

Present your group's findings to the class.
Your presentation should include:
• How many students use each device?
• Which electronic devices do students use for study / relaxation / social interaction?
• How often do they use these devices? Give possible reasons.
