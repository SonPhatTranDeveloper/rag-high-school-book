Speaking

Work in groups. What other features should a smart home have? How will they help us? Use the expressions you learnt in Unit 5 to help you.

- ... (will) help(s) / allow(s) / enable(s) us to do sth.
- ... is / are used to do sth / for sth / for doing sth.

Example: I think a smart home should have a smart heating system that is controlled from a mobile phone. This will allow us to save energy and money.

Reading

1 Read the text. Match the highlighted words with their meanings.

There are two types of community service. The first one is a kind of punishment. For example, people who litter may be forced to clean up the streets. In this case, they may not feel happy about the work. The second type of community service is voluntary. This means people are willing, or pleased to do the work. For instance, people may volunteer to build houses for poor people, or raise money for children in mountainous areas.

However, it does not mean that volunteering is always a selfless act because volunteers may also benefit from the volunteering activities. For example, they may volunteer to meet new people, to develop social skills, or to 'find themselves' (learn what they truly want in life). In general, people may volunteer not just to help others, but also to help themselves.
