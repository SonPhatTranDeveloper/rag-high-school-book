## PROJECT

### GO GREEN WEEKEND

Work in groups. Make a plan for a Go Green Weekend event. Think of activities that you can organise during the weekend. You should also provide the reasons and expected results of each activity you suggest.

Present your plan to the class. Your presentation should include the following:

| GO GREEN WEEKEND | | | | |
|-------------------|---|---|---|---|
| Activity | Time | Place | Reason | Expected result |
|----------|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Picking up litter | Sunday morning | City park | The park is dirty because many people drop litter on the paths. | It will make the park cleaner and more beautiful. |
