COLLECT WATER TO LIVE A GREEN LIFE

Water is essential for life. Therefore, the methods of collecting water are important for meeting its growing need.

The traditional method involves collecting rainwater and storing it for later use. Rainwater is collected from a roof and sent to a container. Collected rainwater is an excellent source of water for people, animals, and plants.

There is also a new method of collecting water. It can turn the tiny drops of water in the air into drinking water. Air-to-water technology creates water from air and releases it all the time. It uses the sun's energy and works well even in dry conditions.

In general, collecting rainwater or creating water from air will allow people to save natural resources, improve the environment, and live a green life.
