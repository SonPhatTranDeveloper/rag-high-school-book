WOMEN'S FOOTBALL

It is commonly thought that football is a sport for men. In fact, it is a sport for women, too. The first recorded football matches between women took place in 1890s in Scotland and England. Women's football became very popular during the First World War when women started working in the factories. In 1921, however, the Football Association (FA) decided that the game was not suitable for women.

The ban lasted for 50 years until it was finally lifted in 1971. In the same year, France and the Netherlands played the first official women's international football match. However, it took 20 years for the first FIFA Women's World Cup to happen in 1991 in Asia. Since then, the competition has been held every four years.

Nowadays, like men's football, women's football is becoming more and more popular. Women's professional football has developed significantly and the Women's World Cup has drawn worldwide interests.
