Gerunds and to-infinitives

Remember!

We use gerunds (verb + -ing):
- after verbs such as avoid, enjoy, and finish.
Example: I enjoy cooking.
- as subjects of sentences.
Example: Learning English is fun.

We use to-infinitives (to + verb):
- after verbs such as want, decide, and allow.
Example: My parents don't allow me to use a smartphone.
- after adjectives to give opinions, starting with It's ...
Example: It's fun to learn English.
- as subjects of sentences.
Example: To learn English is fun.

Note: Some verbs such as like, love, and hate can be followed by either gerunds or to-infinitives.
Example: I like playing / to play computer games.

Grammar

Present perfect

Remember!

We use the present perfect (have / has + past participle) to talk about:
- something that happened in the past, but is still true or important now.
Example: I have lost my key. Now I can't open the door.
- something that started in the past, and is still happening now (often used with since or for).
Example: They have lived here for a year.
- something that was completed in the very recent past (often used with just or recently).
Example: He has just finished his homework.
