1 Listen and read.

Long: Hi, Nick. What are you doing?
Nick: I'm watching the video that my geography teacher uploaded on Eclass.
Long: Really? What is it about?
Nick: It's about global warming. My teacher asked us to watch the video and find more information about this topic.
Long: So, is watching the video part of your homework?
Nick: Yes, then next week, we'll work in groups and discuss the topic in class.
Long: Sounds interesting. You can watch the video many times and also search for more information at home.
Nick: You're right. I'm not good at taking notes in class, you know. So I prefer this way of learning. It gives me a chance to discuss with my classmates, who may have original ideas on the topic.
Long: Does your teacher often ask you to prepare materials at home and discuss in class, Nick?
Nick: Yes, she does. We're doing a lot of projects that help us understand the lessons better. This way of studying, which gives us more control over our own learning, is quite useful.
Long: You're lucky. My teachers use very traditional methods of teaching at my school. I wish I could try these new learning activities.
