## I GETTING STARTED

A talented artist!

1. Listen and read.

Mai: That pop singer looks great, Ann!

Ann: Yeah. He's a popular teen idol around the world now.

Mai: Really? You must be a fan of his!

Ann: Yep, I really love his music. He's a talented artist who can write music and play many musical instruments. He has received several awards such as the Grammy, Billboard Music and Teen Choice Awards.

Mai: Wow! Did he go to a music school?

Ann: No, he didn't, but he learnt to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet by himself. When he was a teenager, he performed at the local theatre in his home town during the tourist season.

Mai: How did he become famous?

Ann: Well, when he was 12, his mother started to upload his cover song videos on social media, and the videos made him an online star within a couple of months.
