### Inventions for the classroom

Work in groups. Your class is organising a Technology Fair. The theme is 'Inventions for the classroom'. Each group is presenting a useful invention for the classroom. This can be an existing or new invention.

Use these questions to help you.
- What is the invention? (If it's a new invention, give it an interesting name.)
- What does it look like?
- How can it be used in the classroom?
- Why do you think it will be a useful invention?
