Go Green Club

1. Listen and read.

Mike: What are you going to do this weekend, Nam?

Nam: I'm going to attend the first meeting of my school's Go Green Club.

Mike: Really? Can you tell me about the club, please?

Nam: Well, it was set up by the Youth Union in my school. Its aim is to improve our environment and encourage people to adopt a greener lifestyle.

Mike: Sounds interesting. What's the first thing you are going to do?

Nam: We're going to clean up the school right after the ceremony.

Mike: Do you have any other planned events?

Nam: Not yet, but I think we'll organise more activities to raise local people's awareness of environmental issues.

Mike: I'm keen to reduce my carbon footprint, but I don't know what to do. Can I join the club?

Nam: Sure. The club welcomes all students in the area. I hope we'll be able to do a lot to protect our environment.

Mike: Great. Can you please give me the time and place of the club meeting?

Nam: OK. I'll text you. See you then.
