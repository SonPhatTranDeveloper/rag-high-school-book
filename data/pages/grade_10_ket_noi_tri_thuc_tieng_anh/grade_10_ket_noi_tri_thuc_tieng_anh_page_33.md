Last Saturday, I went to the International Youth Music Festival with some friends. This music event was even bigger and better than last year. There were a lot of exciting performances with many famous bands and singers from all over the world. I must say that they were really cool on stage! We had a chance to see our favourite idols perform live and listen to their greatest hits. We also tasted a lot of yummy food from different countries such as Korea, Mexico, and Thailand.

This year the festival took place in a big country park, so there was plenty of space for us to enjoy the music and relax. We all felt excited when going to this festival because we could make new friends and enjoy the party atmosphere ...
