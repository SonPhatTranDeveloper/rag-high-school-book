A. The United Nations (UN) was created in 1945. It is an organisation of most of the world's countries. Its main goal is world peace. It also works to reduce poverty and improve people's lives in other ways. Viet Nam joined the organisation in 1977. Since then, our country has become more active and has participated in many UN activities including peacekeeping.

B. UNICEF was formed in 1946. It works in over 190 countries to help improve health and education of children. It particularly aims to support the most disadvantaged children all over the world. UNICEF's aim in Viet Nam is to protect children and make sure they are healthy, educated and safe from harm.

C. UNDP was formed in 1965 as part of the UN. It provides technical support, expert advice and training to help people in developing countries have a better life. In Viet Nam, UNDP works closely with the government to reduce poverty and improve people's lives.
