Remember!

A relative clause gives more information about a person or thing by defining the noun before it. It usually begins with a relative pronoun: who, that, which or whose.

There are two types of relative clauses:

1. A defining relative clause gives essential information about the person or thing mentioned.
Example: The man who visited us yesterday is a famous doctor.

2. A non-defining relative clause gives extra information about the person or thing mentioned. It is often placed between commas.
Example: My uncle, who visited us yesterday, is a famous doctor.

2 Join the following sentences. Use who, that, which or whose. Add commas where necessary.

1. My brother teaches me how to use a laptop. He is good at computers.
