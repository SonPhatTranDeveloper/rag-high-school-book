## Culture

1 Read the text below and complete the diagram (page 50) about Save the Children.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organisation that helps improve children's lives. It was set up in the United Kingdom in 1919, and now it is working in 120 countries around the world.

Save the Children started its work in Viet Nam in 1990. It provides practical support in different areas. One of the areas that the organisation particularly focuses on is education. It has organised different training courses to help teachers improve their teaching skills and use digital technology in their classrooms. It is also working on projects that create more opportunities for children in remote areas to go to school. By providing these children with books and other school materials, Save the Children makes sure they have access to learning. In addition, the organisation offers training on life-saving skills for both teachers and students in case of disasters. Children and households in need can also receive support from Save the Children.
