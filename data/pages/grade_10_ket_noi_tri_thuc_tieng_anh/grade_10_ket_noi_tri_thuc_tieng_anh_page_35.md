## Chau van singing

Chau van singing is an ancient form of Vietnamese performance art which combines singing and dancing. It started in the Northern Delta region of Viet Nam around the 16th century, and later spread to all parts of the country. It is used to praise gods or national heroes.

There are several types of chau van singing. One typical type is hat tho or worship singing - the slow chanting including an act of worship. Another type is hat hau - the singing and dancing of a psychic.

The main musical instruments used in chau van performance are the moon-shaped lute, bamboo clappers, drum, and gong.

The costumes of chau van performers are very important. The style of clothes, hats, and belts depends on the rank of the gods or saints the performers worship. It has changed over time, but the rules about the colours have stayed the same.

As a form of traditional performance art, chau van singing was recognised as part of Vietnamese national culture.
