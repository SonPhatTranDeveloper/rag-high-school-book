BRITISH FAMILY VALUES

Family values are ideas about how people want to live their family life and are passed on from parents to children. Strong family values can prepare children for a happy life. Results of a recent survey in the UK show that even though modern family life has changed greatly, a number of traditional family values are still important in the UK nowadays.

On top of the list are the values of being truthful and honest, and respecting older people. Children are taught to tell the truth from an early age. They learn to show respect to older people, who have a wealth of life experiences. Having good table manners is the third important family value. Coming fourth and fifth on the list are the values of remembering to say please and thank you, and helping with family chores respectively.

It is clear that in the 21st century, British people still follow some traditional family values.
