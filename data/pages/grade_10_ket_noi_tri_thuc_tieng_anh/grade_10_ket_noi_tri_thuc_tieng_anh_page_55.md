Artificial Intelligence

1 Look at the pictures of Asimo and Sophia and discuss the questions below in pairs.
1. What are they?
2. What do you think they can do?

2 Read the text below and choose the best title for it.
A. AI development over time
B. Robots: The best AI inventions
C. AI in use today
D. AI in education

In 2000, Asimo, a robot created by Honda, amazed everyone by just walking down the stairs. Twenty years later, a robot named Sophia can even communicate with people by using human language and expressing emotions.

However, robots are just one example of Artificial Intelligence (AI) - the study and development of machines that can copy human intelligence. Nowadays, AI has been applied to various areas of life.

At home, devices such as vacuum cleaners can now use AI to measure the room size and recognise any furniture. They can then decide on the most effective way to clean the house.

In transport, AI can be used on many smartphones to collect information about traffic. This can then help drivers find the most suitable route. Travelling has become much more convenient thanks to AI.

At work, the uses of AI are even more useful and exciting. Computer programmes, such as AI software or chatbots, can help customers plan their holidays, book flights and hotels, and answer questions.

AI is one of the most important inventions of the 21st century. It has completely changed our daily work and life.

3 Read the text again and match the pictures with the uses of AI.

4 Decide whether the following statements are true (T) or false (F).
1. Sophia can show emotions when talking to humans.
2. AI helps to make machines that think and act like humans.
3. AI is one of the most important inventions of the 20th century.

5 Work in groups and discuss how AI can be used in schools. Then share your ideas with the class.

The page includes two images: one of a humanoid robot labeled "Asimo in 2000", and another of a humanoid robot with a more human-like appearance labeled "Sophia in 2020". There are also three smaller images showing a smartphone, a robotic vacuum cleaner, and a chatbot icon, which are to be matched with different uses of AI mentioned in the text.
