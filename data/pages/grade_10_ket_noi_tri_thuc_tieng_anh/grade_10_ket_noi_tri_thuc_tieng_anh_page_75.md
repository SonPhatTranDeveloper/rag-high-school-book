PROJECT

STUDENTS' FUTURE JOBS

Work in groups. Choose any class in your school and do a survey to find out:
• the number of boys and girls.
• how many of them would like to work as surgeons, airline pilots, nurses and shop assistants, or do other jobs in the future.

Class:

Number of students | Surgeons | Airline pilots | Nurses | Shop assistants | Others
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
____ boys | | | | |
____ girls | | | | |

Report your results to the class. Which of the jobs is the least popular among the boys and which one the least popular among the girls? Give possible reasons.
