4.2 The second conditional
We use the second conditional to talk about an imaginary situation or event and its result.
If I lived in a bigger house, I'd have parties every weekend.

We form the second conditional by using the past simple in the conditional if clause and would + infinitive in the result clause.

Conditional clause | Result clause
If I lived by the sea, | I'd learn to surf.
(past simple) | (would + infinitive)

Notice that you can use were instead of was in the conditional clause with I, he and she. Both was and were are generally acceptable, although using were is considered more correct, especially in formal situations.
If I were you, I'd spend more time revising.
If she were older, she'd find her own flat.

We normally use could for would + can.
If we lived nearer to each other, we could meet up more often.
