# 3C Listening

## The body's limits
I can listen for specific information.

1 SPEAKING: Describe and compare the photos. What are the similarities and differences between the activities? Use the words below to help you.

become dehydrated  climber  desert  food and water  frostbite  high altitude  oxygen  tent

> Listening Strategy
> Some listening tasks may involve listening out for numbers, dates and measurements. Make sure you know how to pronounce these so that you can identify the information when you hear it.

2 🔊1:31 Read the Listening Strategy. Then try to say the numbers and measurements below. Listen and check.

Large numbers: 4,500  100,000  250,000  2.5 million
Small numbers: 0  0.6  0.04  2.08
Years: 1500  1535  2000  2015  2150  the 1980s
Fractions: 1/2  1/3  1/4  1/5  1/10  3  1/2
Percentages: 50%  57%
Ratios and ranges: 2:1  10:1  aged 18–25
from 0–100   in 31 seconds
Temperature: -40°C  0°C  5°C  15°C

3 🔊1:32 Read and listen to the article. Complete the article with numbers and measurements from exercise 2.

There are many amazing stories of human survival, but actually our bodies are very fragile and do not cope well with extremes. Polar explorers can cope with temperatures of ¹_____, but only if they keep warm. Most people will collapse if their body temperature drops by only ²_____, and if it drops by ³_____, they'll die. Heat can be just as dangerous. Temperatures of 35°C are safe, provided humidity is not above ⁴_____. High altitudes are dangerous too. We pass out when the pressure falls

4 🔊1:33 Listen to an interview with a scientist. Which of the people he talks about tested the body's limits deliberately?

5 🔊1:33 Read the sentences aloud, paying attention to the numbers. Then listen again and decide whether the sentences are true or false. Write T or F and correct the false sentences.

1 When a Russian space capsule had a major problem in 1971, the cosmonauts died in less than 30 seconds.
2 In 1966, a scientist passed out after 15 seconds in a vacuum.
3 The scientist passed out for 27 seconds.
4 In the 1960s, Randy Gardner stayed awake for more than 250 hours.
5 After staying awake for so long, Randy Gardner then slept for almost 50 hours.

6 🔊1:34 PRONUNCIATION Listen and mark the words that are stressed in the sentences from exercise 5. Then practise saying the sentences yourself.

7 SPEAKING: Discuss the questions in pairs.

1 Have you ever been awake all night or most of the night? If so, when / where / why?
2 Have you ever felt very cold? If so, when / where / why?
3 Have you ever experienced high altitude? If so, when / where / why? How did you feel?

below ⁵_____ of normal atmospheric pressure. This happens at about ⁶_____ metres. Climbers can go higher because their bodies gradually get used to it, but no one survives for long at 8,000 metres. At high altitudes, lack of oxygen is another problem. At ground level, about ⁷_____ of the air is oxygen. If that falls below ⁸_____, we die.
