3.1 Speculating and predicting

We use will / won't to make predictions.
We'll send people to Mars in the near future.
Liverpool won't win the Champions League this year.

We can use phrases with will / won't to make the predictions stronger or weaker:
• I think / I don't think / I doubt / I'm not sure + will (but not won't)
  I don't think she'll come to the party.
  NOT I think she won't... X
  I doubt she'll come to the party.
  NOT I doubt she won't... X
• I'm certain / I'm sure + will / won't
  I'm certain she'll come to the party.
  I'm sure she won't come to the party.

We can also use adverbs such as probably and definitely with will and won't.
She'll definitely come to the party.
She probably won't come to the party.

We use may / might / could + the infinitive without to to talk about future possibilities.
My phone may / might / could be in my bedroom.

We use may not / might not for the negative, to say that it is possible that something will not happen. We don't use could not.
My phone may not / might not be in my bedroom.
NOT My phone could not be in my bedroom. X

1 USE OF ENGLISH Complete the second sentence so that it has the same meaning as the first. Use the words in brackets.

3.2 The first conditional

We use the first conditional to make predictions about the future.
If I'm late for school, my teacher will tell me off.

We form the first conditional with the present simple in the conditional clause and will + infinitive in the result clause.

Conditional clause | Result clause
------------------ | -------------
If I'm late for school, | my teacher will tell me off.
(present simple) | (will + infinitive)
