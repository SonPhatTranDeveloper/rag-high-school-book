## An opinion essay

*I can write an opinion essay.*

1 SPEAKING Discuss the questions in pairs. Give reasons for your opinions.
1 Do you think most teenagers have a healthy lifestyle?
2 Do you have a healthy lifestyle? Why? / Why not?

2 Read the task below. What two different elements does the task contain?

Many people agree that teenagers don't get enough exercise. Write an essay in which you give your own view of the problem and propose ways of solving it.

3 Read the essay. What is the writer's opinion about the problem? How many solutions does she propose?

Most people agree that the lack of exercise in teenagers' lives is a serious problem. But what are the causes of this problem and what can we do to address them?

I strongly believe that today's teenagers spend too much time playing on electronic gadgets. They hardly ever do outdoor activities and this is why many of them do not get enough exercise. What is more, many teenagers are overweight and this makes them less willing to do exercise.

In order to tackle this problem, a number of measures are necessary. In my view, it is unrealistic to limit the amount of time teenagers spend on gadgets. What I propose instead is that we make sure school canteens only serve healthy food. Furthermore, I would strongly recommend that we give all teenagers free membership to their local sports facilities.

To conclude, lack of exercise can cause long-term health problems, so it is vital that we act now. It seems to me that the measures I propose will begin to remedy the situation.
