2 Read the article. What is unusual about John Cage's most famous composition?

Experimental music by John Cage

Most composers want their music to contain something different - a distinctive melody or rhythm, or an unusual harmony which no one has thought of before. But has anyone gone further than composer John Cage in the search for originality?

In 1951, John Cage wanted to find somewhere he could experience complete silence. He went inside a special soundproof room and expected to hear nothing, but instead heard two sounds, one high-pitched and one low-pitched. Later, the sound engineer explained that the first was the sound of his nervous system and the second was the sound of his blood circulating. Cage realised that nowhere is completely silent - you can always hear something. A year later, he composed his most famous piece: 4'33" ('four minutes and thirty-three seconds'). In this piece, the performer walks on stage and then ... nothing happens. He or she does not play anything at all. Everybody in the audience listens to nothing for exactly four minutes and 33 seconds. Then the performer bows and everyone applauds!
