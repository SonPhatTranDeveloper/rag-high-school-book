Writing Strategy
Where there is a word limit for the writing task, make sure you keep within it. If you went over the limit, decide which words you can delete. For example, there may be unnecessary adjectives or examples. When you have cut the words, make sure that a) the text still makes sense and b) all points in the task are still covered.

4 SPEAKING Read the Writing Strategy. In pairs, look through the blog post in exercise 2 and suggest twelve words you could delete. Then compare your ideas with another pair's.

5 Read the task below. Then prepare a plan for your blog post.

You recently went to a show performed by a number of different clubs at school. Write a blog post about it.
• Where and when did the show take place?
• Who attended the event and how did they react?
• Give your personal opinion of the event.
• Suggest two improvements for next year.

Paragraph 1: the time, the place and the clubs
Paragraph 2: the attendees and their reactions
Paragraph 3: your opinions
Paragraph 4: suggested improvements

One Saturday last month, the school organised an open day for students and parents to learn about all the school clubs. The event took place in the playground and also in the school hall.

More than two hundred people came to the school to find out about the activities the school can offer. Most of them were parents of primary school children who are going to start at the school in September, at the beginning of the next school year.

More than twenty different school clubs had stalls in the playground. Students and teachers at the stalls explained to the visitors what goes on at the clubs. In the school hall, there were karate displays from the martial arts club and a short performance by the choir.

In my view, the day was a great success. Since the open day, lots of people have been asking for information about clubs. As well as that, the school has received suggestions for new clubs, including ballroom dancing and ice skating!

6 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Compare your notes from exercise 5 and suggest at least one improvement for your partner's plan.

7 Write a blog post (150–180 words) using the task and plan from exercise 5. Include phrases from exercise 3 if appropriate.
