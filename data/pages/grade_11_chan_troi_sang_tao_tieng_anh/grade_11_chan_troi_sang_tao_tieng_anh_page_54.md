# Imaginary situations
I can talk about imaginary situations and things I would like to change.

1 SPEAKING Read the fact file about Castle Howard, a stately home in the north of England. Would you like to live in a house like this? Why? / Why not?

• Built around 1700, it has 145 rooms.
• It is the private home of the Howard family, who have lived there for over 300 years.
• It has been open to the public since 1952.

2 2.09 Read and listen to the dialogue. What two outdoor and indoor changes do the speakers mention?

Alfie: This is an amazing place. I wish I lived here.
Macy: Me too. If only I were a member of the Howard family!
Alfie: But if it were my house, I wouldn't allow people to visit.
Macy: That's mean! You'd get bored on your own.
Alfie: Oh, I'd let my friends visit, of course. But not the public.
Macy: If you had a party, you could invite hundreds of people!
Alfie: I know. The parties would be better if I made a few changes, though.
Macy: What kinds of changes?
Alfie: Well, if those trees weren't there, there'd be room for a swimming pool!
Macy: You could make some changes inside as well. I mean, look at this corridor.
Alfie: The Antique Passage, you mean?
Macy: Yes. If you took away all the statues, you could build a great bowling alley there!
