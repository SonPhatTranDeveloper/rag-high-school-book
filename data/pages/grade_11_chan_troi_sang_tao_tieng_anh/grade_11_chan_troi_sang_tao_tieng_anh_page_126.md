although, even though, in spite of, and despite are concession clauses. A concession clause introduces an idea which seems the opposite of the idea in the main clause or makes it more surprising.
Even though he's in his eighties, he still plays football.

We can use although or even though to introduce a concession clause. The clause can come before or after the main clause.
