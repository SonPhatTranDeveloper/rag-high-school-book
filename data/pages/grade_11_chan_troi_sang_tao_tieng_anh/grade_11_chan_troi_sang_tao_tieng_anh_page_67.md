DADDY

Dad, I'm interested in playing video games, you know. However, you are always unhappy with that. You get curious about the types of game I play. You're afraid that I'll be addicted to it. You're worried about the amount of time I spend online. Although I'm a teenager, I'm aware of what I should do. I'm responsible enough for my studying. You see, I'm always successful at maths and English. I love you, Dad.

Dear my boy, I feel dissatisfied with your staying up late playing video games. I'm sometimes shocked at your words when I remind you to do homework. I know you're good at maths and English, but I think you need to spend more time playing sports. And don't be too sensitive to my advice. How about a game of badminton with me next Saturday evening? Lots of love.
