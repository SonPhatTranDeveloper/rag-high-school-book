The conditional if clause usually comes first, but it can come after the result clause.
My teacher will tell me off if I'm late for school.

The modal verbs may, might and could can be used instead of will or won't in the result clause in order to make the prediction less certain.
Scientists may find a cure for cancer if governments invest more money in medical research.

3.3 Future continuous and future perfect

We form the future perfect with will have + past participle.
She'll have finished that book soon.

We form the future continuous with will be + -ing form.
I'll be waiting for you at the bus stop.

We use the future perfect to talk about a completed action in the future. We use the future continuous to talk about an action in progress in the future. Look at the calendar and sentences below.

[Calendar showing Mon to Fri with an arrow pointing to Mon and text "Amy is travelling to Japan."]

On Monday, Amy will be travelling to Japan. (The journey will be in progress.)
By Friday, Amy will have arrived in Japan. (The journey will be finished.)
