## A formal letter

*I can write a formal letter of enquiry.*

1 SPEAKING Describe the photo. Have you ever stayed in a youth hostel? How are they different from hotels?

2 Read the writing task and the letter. Has the writer covered all four points in the task?

You are planning to visit Bristol in the UK this summer with a small group of friends and have been given a recommendation for a youth hostel. Write a letter to the youth hostel in which you
• give information about your group.
• inform them of the dates you want to stay and ask about availability.
• ask about food and drink.
• ask for suggestions about places to visit in Bristol.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to enquire about a visit to your youth hostel in Bristol next month. I'll be travelling to Bristol with three mates from school. All four of us are female and aged seventeen or eighteen. We're planning to stay for seven nights between 10 and 17 August. Please tell me whether you have beds available for those dates. I'd also like to know whether your youth hostel has a café or restaurant. If not, would it be possible to recommend any places to eat near the hostel which are not too expensive? This will be our first visit to Bristol. Although I have read about the city on the internet, I'd love to hear any tips for places to visit in the city. I look forward to getting an answer from you in due course so that we can finalise the details of our visit.

Yours faithfully,
Hazel Jones

### Writing Strategy
1 Divide your letter into paragraphs.
2 In the first paragraph, which can be a single sentence, say why you are writing.
3 Each paragraph should have its own topic. It is usually best to deal with each point in the task in a separate paragraph.
4 In the final paragraph, which can be a single sentence, say that you expect a reply.
5 Avoid colloquial language and short forms.

3 Read the Writing Strategy and do the tasks below.

1 Divide the letter into six paragraphs.
2 Find three examples of short forms. Correct them.
3 Find words and phrases in the letter which would be better expressed with these more formal words and phrases:
   friends   I would be grateful if you could inform me
   I would certainly be interested   receiving a reply
   recommendations
4 Find words and phrases in the letter which express these things in a more formal way:
   ask about   soon   sort out   tell me about
