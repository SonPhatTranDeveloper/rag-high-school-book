# 3F Reading

## Body clock

I can understand an article about the human body clock.

1 **SPEAKING** Work in pairs. Ask and answer the questions.
1 What time do you usually go to bed a) on weekdays and b) at the weekend?
2 What time do you usually get up a) on weekdays and b) at the weekend?
3 Have those times changed much since you were younger?

### Reading Strategy
When matching questions with texts, follow these steps:
1 Read the text to get a general idea of the meaning.
2 Read the task's lead-in line very carefully (In which period of the day ...). Then read all the options carefully.
3 Read the paragraphs of the text carefully one by one and match them to the correct option.
4 If you can't find the answer, leave it for now and come back to it later.

2 Read the Reading Strategy. Then read the article to get an idea of the general meaning. Which is the best summary: a, b, c or d?

The writer's main purpose is to explain
a why children need more sleep than adults.
b why we should always get lots of sleep.
c why our bodies feel more or less tired at different times of day.
d why some people feel more alert than others.

3 Match the paragraphs (A–H) with questions 1–10 below. Two of the paragraphs match more than one question.

In which period of the day
1 do you completely stop digesting food?
2 is it best to be physically active?
3 do our bodies have difficulty digesting certain foods?
4 are older people more likely to have accidents?
5 does your body contain the most melatonin?
6 are you best at remembering things over short periods of time?
7 are you at your strongest physically?
8 does your body stop making melatonin?
9 is your body at its coolest?
10 does your body begin to become cooler?

4 Read the article again and answer the questions.
1 How much more sleep does a young child need than an adolescent?
2 What's the difference between 'larks' and 'owls'?
3 Why is it better not to exercise early in the morning?
4 When do sportspeople think is a good time to try to break a record?
5 If you want to lose weight, which is more important: when you eat or how much you eat?
6 Why is it not a good idea to use gadgets such as tablets and mobiles late at night?

5 **SPEAKING** Work in pairs. Ask and answer.
1 Do you get enough sleep? If not, why not?
2 How do you feel if you don't get enough sleep? What things are more difficult to do?
3 Do you use gadgets such as mobiles late at night? What for? Do you find that they keep you awake?
4 When are you most alert? Are you a 'lark', an 'owl', or in between the two? Explain your answer.
