Review Unit 2

Reading
Read two texts. Circle the correct answer (A–D).

John has been a keen reader and his favourite topic is climate change. Looking at his bookshelf, you'll be amazed at how many special books on climate change he has. Most of these books are his own buy and he is very proud of his collection. Some others are his dad's souvenirs from his business trips abroad. Believe it or not, all you can find on John's wish lists are titles of new books on climate change and global warming. John once lent his collection to the school library for a book fair and he even gave a talk on causes and effects of global warming at his science club. His audience was fascinated by his explanation of the natural greenhouse effect and the human-enhanced process in which greenhouse gases trap the heat and radiation, thereby raising the earth's temperature.

1 It can be inferred from the passage that
A John's friends don't care about his book collection.
B John's book collection is exploited to the fullest.
C John spends most of his free time collecting and reading books.
D John only receives books as birthday presents.

Hobby-related holidays are on the way to becoming one of the most lucrative forms of tourism, and younger people are definitely joining in. Of course, sports-related camps have been a huge part of tourism for ages, but what if you're someone with little interest in tennis or basketball? A good option for you might be a two-week photography tour – with stunning scenery, ancient buildings and sometimes even underwater photography. Alternatively, if you are interested in nature, you can spend two weeks in an exotic location helping to identify rare plants and animals – while soaking up some sun and meeting like-minded people.

2 What does the writer say about hobby-related holidays?
A They have existed for a long time.
B They are mainly sports-related.
C They are usually for young people.
D They are popular and varied.
