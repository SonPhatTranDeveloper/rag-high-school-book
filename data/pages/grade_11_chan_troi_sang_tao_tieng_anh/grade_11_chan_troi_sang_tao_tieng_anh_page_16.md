Past tense contrast
I can talk about the past using a variety of past tenses.

1 Look at the photo. How old do you think the woman is? Why do you think she is famous?

2 Read the text and check your ideas.

Jeanne Calment, the person with the longest lifespan ever, was born in 1875, in Arles, France. Her parents ran a shop in the town and she worked there when she was a teenager. While she was serving in the shop in 1888, she met Vincent van Gogh, who had come in to buy pencils. She thought he was 'dirty, ugly and badly dressed'!

In 1896, at the age of 21, she married Fernand Calment and then gave birth to a daughter, Yvonne. Fernand was very wealthy so Jeanne never needed to work. She lived in Arles for the rest of her life, dying on 5 August 1997 at the age of 122.

So how did Jeanne manage to live so long? The French have their own theories, noting that she ate more than two pounds of chocolate a week and rode a bicycle until she was 100!
