SEPAK TAKRAW

Sepak Takraw is a popular sports game in South East Asia, whose name comes from two languages. Sepak means 'kick' in Malay, and takraw means 'ball' in Thai. The sport is believed to come from a traditional Chinese game.

Played on a court with a rattan ball, Sepak Takraw is basically a cross between volleyball and football. With three people on each side, players have to keep the ball in play using their feet, chest, head, or knee. Committing a foul will offer a point to the opposing team. The team with 21 points on a set will win that set. The team who wins the first two sets is the winner.

Sepak Takraw helps develop excellent eye-foot coordination, leg strength and flexibility.

Thailand won the most gold medals in Sepak Takraw at SEA Games 31.

KARATE

Karate, the Japanese word for 'empty hand', is believed to have begun long ago on Okinawa, an island of Japan.

In karate, practitioners learn to breathe, move, and stand in a certain way. They are told to breathe out from their bellies and also learn to let out a big shout as they move.

A white uniform called a gi and a coloured belt are required. Practitioners start with a white belt and train hard until they get a black one.

Karate can provide a number of benefits to those who practice it. In addition to teaching concepts such as respect and discipline, it can help build confidence and self-defence skills.

SEA Games 31 saw the victory of the Vietnamese karate team with 7 gold medals.

VOVINAM - VIET VO DAO

Vovinam, one of the most popular Vietnamese martial arts, was created by Grandmaster Nguyen Loc (1912-1960) in 1936.

Vovinam involves the use of different body parts such as hands, elbows, legs, and knees. Practitioners also learn to perform with long sticks, swords, knives, and fans.

Not only does Vovinam help strengthen practitioners' mind and body but it also encourages a healthy lifestyle. Vovinam is also known for its practicality, as it can be used in a wide range of self-defense situations.

Vovinam competitions have been held in the regional sports event of South East Asia since 2011.

At SEA Games 31, Viet Nam ranked first in Vovinam with 6 gold medals.
