2 Read the article and check your ideas.

MR CONNECTED
Chris Dancy loves technology. A few years ago, he noticed that he had very little information about his habits, health and lifestyle, and he wanted to lose some weight. So he bought some gadgets that could collect this information and help him understand himself better. Now he is connected to 700 sensors that record every detail of his life. He monitors what he eats and drinks, how long he sleeps, how much he spends, his mood ... even the activity of his dogs! Few, if any, people collect as much data about themselves as Chris.

Most of his gadgets are attached to him. He wears gadgets on both arms, a heart rate monitor and a device that counts calories. He has a smart watch too, which he can wear on either wrist. His house and car are also full of gadgets. Every one of them sends data to his computer, and at the end of each day Chris spends a little time analysing it. The smartwatch is the only gadget he wears all the time. He doesn't wear all of his gadgets 24/7, but he has so many systems that automatically track his activity that there aren't any days when there is no monitoring at all.

LOOK OUT!
We can use most quantifiers with of before a determiner (e.g. the, his, these) and a noun.
All of my friends have got phones.
However, we cannot use of with every or no. Instead, we use every one of and none of with a plural verb or with a singular verb (in formal style).
None of my friends have / has got a tablet.
