## British public schools

In the UK, 93% of children go to state schools, which are funded by the government. The remaining 7% go to private schools, which the government does not fund or control. The students pay fees to attend these schools. A small group of very old private schools are, confusingly, known as 'public schools'. These include Eton College, which has educated nineteen British Prime Ministers over the past three centuries – as well as many other famous people from around the world, including Prince William and Prince Harry, actor Hugh Laurie and the former king of Nepal.

To many people, these public schools seem very odd and old-fashioned, with their strange uniforms and confusing traditions. For example, all of the public schools divide the academic year into three terms. At Eton College, these are called 'halves', but at Charterhouse they're called 'quarters' (and the shortest of the three is known as the 'long quarter').

Although private schools seem irrelevant to most British people, the influence they have on society is very real. That is because a very large number of people in important positions attended these schools, including 71% of senior judges and 62% of senior officers in the armed forces. Some people even argue that the UK parliament does not represent the country because 32% of MPs are privately educated.
