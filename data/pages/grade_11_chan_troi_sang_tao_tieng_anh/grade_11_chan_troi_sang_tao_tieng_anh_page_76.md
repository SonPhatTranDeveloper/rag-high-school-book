Cleft sentences
I can use cleft sentences to emphasise a piece of information.

1 Read the article. What qualities does she think young people should have to set up their own business successfully?

Amelia Humfress is a 24-year-old entrepreneur whose aim is to make her own company, Steer, the best in the world for teaching people how to make their own websites. She has decided that it is the courses of Steer that can make it different from other companies. The courses vary from web design to computer coding. They focus more on the learners' chances to experience and practice rather than theoretical lessons. Amelia did not start out setting up such a school. It was when she was looking for a web design course for herself that the idea for the company Steer came to her. Her plan grew slowly. At first, she lacked confidence, but she then found an office where she could start the business. Soon her business grew quickly. Amelia thinks that more young people should start the businesses that they dream about. It is just a lack of confidence, not any other factor that holds them back.
