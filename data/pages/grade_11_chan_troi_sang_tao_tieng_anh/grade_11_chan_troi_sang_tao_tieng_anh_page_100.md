The third conditional
I can talk about imaginary events in the past.

1 SPEAKING Describe the photo. What are the people discussing, do you think?

[Image description: A photo shows two people in a car, seemingly having a discussion. One person appears to be gesturing or explaining something to the other.]

Sally: We were supposed to be there by five and it's 5.15 already. If you'd remembered the satnav, we wouldn't have got lost.
Ben: We aren't lost. I know where we are on the map. We're nearly there.
Sally: If we'd left home on time, we'd have arrived by now.
Ben: Well, that isn't my fault, is it? We'd have left on time if your mum hadn't phoned just as we were leaving.
Sally: Don't blame my mum! And we wasted so much time at the services. If we'd made sandwiches (like I suggested), we wouldn't have had to stop for lunch.
Ben: Look, we're here now, and only fifteen minutes late. That isn't so bad.

Pronounced as: would've    I'd've    wouldn't've
