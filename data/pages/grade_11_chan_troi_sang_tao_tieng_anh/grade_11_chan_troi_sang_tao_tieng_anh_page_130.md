8.4 Question tags
We use question tags when we want somebody to confirm something that we are saying. A statement with a question tag often sounds more polite than a direct question or a plain statement.
You live in Madrid, don't you?

When the main verb is affirmative, the question tag is negative, and vice versa.
She was late, wasn't she?
She wasn't late, was she?

We use the verb be, auxiliary verbs (do, have), or modal verbs (will, would, etc.), depending on the tense of the verb in the statement.

Tense             Statement           Question tag
Present simple    She likes dogs,     doesn't she?
Present continuous He's eating,       isn't he?
Past simple       She broke her arm,  didn't she?
Present perfect   It's finished,      hasn't it?
Past perfect      They hadn't met,    had they?
can               She can't swim,     can she?
will              She won't forget,   will she?
would             He'd enjoy skiing,  wouldn't he?
