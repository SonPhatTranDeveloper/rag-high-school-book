## A message

I can write a message in response to an advertisement.

1. **SPEAKING** Work in pairs. What is a penfriend? Think of three reasons why somebody might want a penfriend in a different country.

> Find a penfriend
> 
> Hi! My name is Adam. I'm sixteen years old and I live in Newcastle in the UK. I'm looking for a penfriend from any country in the world. Send me a message and tell me about yourself and your family. Also, could you please tell me why you are looking for a penfriend? Thanks - and I hope to hear from you soon!
> 
> Click here to reply to Adam

2. Read the advertisement from a website for international penfriends above. What information does Adam ask for?

3. Read the task and the message below. Does Vinh provide all of the information that Adam asks for? What does Vinh ask for more information about?

You have seen this advertisement on a website for international penfriends. Write a message in reply and provide the information Adam asks for. Include a request for information in your message.

> Find a penfriend
> 
> Hi! My name's Vinh and I'm from Viet Nam. I'm fifteen years old and live in Ho Chi Minh City with my parents and my younger sister. I'm into football, and my sister's mad about pop music.
> 
> I'd like to have an English penfriend because I'm studying English at school and would like to visit England one day. Would you mind telling me more about Newcastle? I know it's got a famous football team, but that's all! Do you enjoy living there?

4. **KEY PHRASES** Look at the polite requests. Which one does Adam use in his advertisement? Which one does Vinh use in his message?

**Polite requests**
Would it be possible for you to...?
Could you please...? Would you mind if...?
Would you mind (+ -ing form)? I wonder if...

5. **SPEAKING** Work in pairs. Request the following information from your partner. Use different phrases from exercise 4 and verbs like tell, explain, describe, etc.

- date of birth
- ideal day out
- taste in music

**Writing Strategy**
Make sure that you a) include all of the points in the task and b) develop each point, that is, add some extra information or detail. Try not to write just one sentence for each point.

6. Read the Writing Strategy. Then look at the message in exercise 3 again. Does Vinh develop the points or does he just write a single sentence for each one?

7. Match sentences 1–5 with sentences a–e. Think of other ways that extra detail or information could be added to sentences 1–5.

1. I go to Harford Community College.
2. I've got two brothers.
3. We moved to a house outside town last month.
4. My name's Huy and I'm seventeen years old.
5. Would you mind if I visited you in August?

a. I live in Ninh Binh with my parents and my sister.
b. I'm doing my A-levels.
c. We needed more space.
d. I'd really like to meet you and your family.
e. One is older than me and one is younger.

8. You are going to do the task in exercise 3. Plan your message, using the prompts below to help you. Think about how you can add extra details.

- Describe yourself and your family.
- Explain your reason for wanting a penfriend.
- Request information from Adam.

9. Write your message (70–80 words) using your plan from exercise 8.

**CHECK YOUR WORK**

- referred to and developed each point in the task?

- checked the spelling and grammar?
