# Go Autonomous- GO GREEN

Since the birth of the car in 1886, transport in big cities has changed a lot. And it is no wonder that many experts think that there will be extraordinary changes in the next few decades.

As technology develops, highways, skylines, subways will be all transformed. Smarter roadways and highways in cities outfitted with IoT sensors will process all kinds of data in real time and alert users of the best transport options. Weather, crashes, traffic conditions will be communicated to users and smart stops will be found everywhere providing renewable energy, green hydrogen or even greener energy, ensuring efficiency and safety on every highway. Tunnels will also be a smart choice because of the reduction of traffic congestion. Underground roads will be built in 3D with a lift system which will take vehicles deep underground and will allow traffic to attain the greatest speed without intersections.

There will also be innovations in the sky. Air taxis are not a new idea, but in the future they will be completely environment-friendly. Aviation gasoline will be no longer used. Green energy will be in place and cost-effective air taxis will enable people to travel from one busy urban city to another in record time.

New technologies such as AI and the rollout of 5G will pave the way for fully autonomous innovation. Cars will not be the only thing to go autonomous. Freight trucks, cargo vehicles, air taxis will all benefit from this technology and that is why the term 'driver' will become extinct.

Transport will go green. Electric or hydrogen power will be mainstream. There will still be issues to solve such as safety, speed and cost, and of course governments will need to make new traffic laws.
