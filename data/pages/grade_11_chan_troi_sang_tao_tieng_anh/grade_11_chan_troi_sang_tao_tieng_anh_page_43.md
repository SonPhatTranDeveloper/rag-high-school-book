## A gut feeling?

Emotions do not just occur in your mind; they also have a physical effect on your body. A group of scientists from Finland decided to find out which emotions affect which parts of the body. They asked 701 volunteers to colour in silhouettes in response to emotional words, stories and videos. The results show that the people generally experience emotions like anger, envy and shame in similar ways.

For example, when you're angry, you probably feel that anger mostly in your chest and head. But if you feel ashamed, you probably notice it in your face and, in particular, your cheeks. Depression makes your whole body feel less active, whereas happiness affects your whole body in a positive way.
