### LEARN THIS! Indirect questions
a We often use indirect questions to sound more polite in formal situations. They begin with phrases like the ones in exercise 4.
Could you tell me what the time is?

b We use if or whether to turn a yes / no question into an indirect question.
Is accommodation included?
I'd like to know if accommodation is included.

c In an indirect question, the word order and verb form are the same as in a direct statement.
Is the job well paid? → Could you tell me if the job is well paid?
