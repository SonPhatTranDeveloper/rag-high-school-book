THE BIG SLEEP OUT

RAISING MONEY FOR PEOPLE WHO SLEEP ROUGH

Nobody knows exactly how many young people in the UK are homeless, but the figure may be as high as 75,000. While the majority of homeless people are unemployed, some have jobs but are still unable to afford accommodation. The Big Sleep Out is a charity event which raises money to tackle homelessness among young people. Big Sleep Outs happen all over the country. People who are not homeless choose to sleep rough for one night. This raises a lot of money each year and reminds politicians to look for a solution to the problem.
