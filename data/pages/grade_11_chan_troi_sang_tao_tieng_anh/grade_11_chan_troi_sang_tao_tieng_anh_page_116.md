It was my mum's birthday last night, so we had the dinner in a restaurant near the station. Restaurant was quite expensive - water was about £5 the bottle - but it was worth it because food was fantastic! For me, a best part of the meal was the main course. My dad and I both had salmon with potatoes and a delicious sauce. My dad said it was very well cooked, and he's chef so he knows about cooking. My brother ordered steak because he hates the fish. My dad had ordered a birthday cake for pudding. We had a great time and didn't leave the restaurant until 11.30 at the night.
