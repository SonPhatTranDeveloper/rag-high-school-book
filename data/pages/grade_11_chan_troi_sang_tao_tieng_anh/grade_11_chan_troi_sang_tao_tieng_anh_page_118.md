Unit 2
2.1 Present perfect and past simple contrast
We use the past simple to talk about a specific occasion in the past.
I went rollerblading last Saturday.

We use the present perfect to talk about an event during a period of time that is still continuing.
I've lived in Cornwall all my life.

We use the present perfect to say how long a situation has existed, often with for, since and how long.
I've been at this school for six years.
'How long have you had that jacket?' 'Since last spring.'

We use the present perfect to talk about an event that has a strong connection with the present, often with just, already and yet.
Look! The sun has come out.
Has it stopped raining yet?
I've lost my maths textbook. Have you seen it?

We use the present perfect to talk about an experience at an unspecified time in the past, often with ever or never.
I've never been to France.
Have you ever eaten Japanese food?
My cousin has met Orlando Bloom.

We often use the present perfect to ask or talk about an experience and then the past simple to give specific information about it.
'Have you been to Italy?' 'Yes, I have. I went there last summer.'

We often use finished past time expressions with the past simple (yesterday, three months ago, last week, in 1999), but unfinished past time expressions with the present perfect (for, since, already, not yet).
I started school in 2006.
I haven't done my homework yet.
I've had a cold for four or five days.

already, yet and just
We use already with the present perfect in affirmative sentences. We put it before the past participle or at the end of the sentence.
Kate has already left. / Kate has left already.

We use yet with the present perfect in negative sentences and questions. We usually put it at the end of the sentence.
Kate hasn't left yet. Has Kate left yet?

We use just with the present perfect in affirmative sentences and questions to mean 'a very short time ago'.
I've just finished my homework.
Have you just eaten?

been and gone
We use both been and gone as the past participle of the verb go. We use been when somebody has returned.
Henry has been to town. (He went to town, but he's here now.)
