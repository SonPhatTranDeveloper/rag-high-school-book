1 Read the article about a film. Explain in your own words what is unusual about the main character.

I USED TO BE older

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button certainly lives up to its title. It is a very unusual film about a man who lives his life backwards: he is born as an old man and dies as a baby.

The story begins in 1918 when a woman gives birth to a baby with the appearance of an elderly man. The mother dies and the father abandons the baby, who is called Benjamin. Two workers at a nursing home, Queenie and Tizzy, decide to look after Benjamin, who fits in with the elderly residents at the home because he looks so old. But as the years pass, Benjamin becomes physically younger.

At the age of twelve, he meets a young girl called Daisy and gets on with her very well despite having the appearance of an old man, but later they lose touch when Benjamin starts working a job on a boat.

Years later, he catches up with Daisy again in Paris. In their forties, they finally look the same age for the first time – and fall in love. They almost marry and settle down together, but they never go through with it. One reason is that Daisy could never put up with Benjamin's strange condition.

In the end, they run out of time: Daisy is becoming an old woman and Benjamin is becoming a child. He finally dies in Daisy's arms as a baby.
