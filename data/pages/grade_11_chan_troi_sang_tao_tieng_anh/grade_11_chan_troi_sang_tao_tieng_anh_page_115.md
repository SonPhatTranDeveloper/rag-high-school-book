Introduction

1.1 Past simple
We form the past simple (affirmative) form of regular verbs by adding -ed.

+ -ed  work → worked  play → played

If the verb ends in -e, we add -d.
+ -d  dance → danced  die → died

If the verb ends in a consonant + -y, we change -y to -i and add -ed.
-y → -ied  study → studied  cry → cried

If the verb ends in a short stressed vowel + a consonant, we double the consonant and add -ed.
-p → -pped  drop → dropped

Some verbs have irregular past simple (affirmative) forms. There are no spelling rules for these forms; you need to learn them by heart. See the irregular verb list in the Workbook.

For the negative, we use didn't + the infinitive without to. For the interrogative, we use did + subject + infinitive without to.
We didn't arrive on time.
Did you bring any food?

The past simple of be is I / he / she / it was or you / we / they were. The past simple of can is could. For the negative and interrogative forms of be and can, we do not use did / didn't.
They weren't at school. Were they ill?
I couldn't see the stage. Could you see it?

1.2 Contrast: present simple and present continuous

We use the present simple:
• for something that always happens or happened regularly (e.g. every week, often, sometimes).
Laura cycles to school every day.
• for facts.
Cows eat grass.

We use the present continuous:
• for something happening at this exact moment or around this time.
Luke is wearing a T-shirt. (at this moment)
Luke is working hard this term. (around this time)
• for future arrangements.
We're playing volleyball tomorrow.

We can use dynamic verbs in simple and continuous forms.
I work in London.
Dad's working in the garden.

Verbs describing a state or situation (stative verbs) are not usually used in continuous tenses.
I understand. (state of mind)
NOT I'm understanding. X
Who does this watch belong to? (possession)
NOT Who is this watch belonging to? X

Common stative verbs:
• hate, like, love, need, prefer, want, wish;
• believe, know, mean, realise, recognise, remember, suppose, understand;
• belong, contain, depend, matter, owe, possess.

There is a group of verbs that can be used as either stative or dynamic verbs. These are some of them:
• appear, consider, feel, look, see, smell, taste, think.
What are you thinking about? (dynamic – to think)
What do you think of my new tie? (stative – to have an opinion)
We're seeing John next week. (dynamic – to meet with somebody)
I see what you mean. (stative – to understand)

1 'Where ____________ you ____________ (go)?'
   'To the shops. I ____________ (need) to get some bread.'
2 ____________ you usually ____________ (wear) jeans to school?
