Writing Strategy
Each point in the task will ask you to do a different thing, such as describe, recommend, relate, express an opinion, suggest, etc. Read the task carefully and make sure that you understand exactly what you are being asked to do.

2 Read the Writing Strategy and the task below. Identify the verbs in each point that tell you what you should do.

You recently bought a new computer. Write a forum post in which you
• describe your experience of using the computer.
• compare it with another computer you have used.
• present the opinions of people who think teenagers rely too much on computers.
• ask other contributors to react to your post.

3 Read the forum posts. Did both writers cover all four points in the way described in the task? Explain your answers.

LEARN THIS! Concession clauses
a Using concession clauses can make your arguments more balanced.
b We can use although or even though to introduce a concession clause. The clause can come before or after the main clause.
The computer is quite powerful even though it's quite small.
Although it's quite small, the computer is quite powerful.
c In spite of and despite also express concession, but are followed by a noun or -ing form, not a clause.
In spite of / Despite its size, it's still quite powerful.

4 Read the Learn this! box. Underline four examples of concession clauses in the forum posts.

Last month I bought a new laptop. I use it every day for schoolwork and for accessing social media. It's also great for messaging my friends.
I used to have a desktop computer. Although it was powerful, it was very slow and it didn't have much storage. Despite its small size, the laptop is lightning-quick and has a massive 1TB hard drive.
Unfortunately my parents are always telling me to get off the computer. They think that teenagers should spend less time interacting with people via a screen and more time talking face-to-face.
I'd be interested to hear what you think about this. Should we spend less time at our computers?

I love my new PC! It's an all-in-one desktop with a widescreen display. It's a really up-to-date model, despite the fact that I got it second-hand on eBay. It's bright green with a black keyboard and a wireless mouse.
Until now, I've always used my mum's old laptop. The screen was much smaller and the operating system was old so it was often impossible to download new software.
I agree that teenagers rely a lot on computers, although I don't really think it's a serious problem.
What do you think? Do you agree with me? Have you bought a new PC recently? What's it like?
