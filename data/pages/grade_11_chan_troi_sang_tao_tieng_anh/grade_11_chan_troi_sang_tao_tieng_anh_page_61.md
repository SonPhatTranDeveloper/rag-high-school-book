# Review Unit 4

## Reading

Read the three texts and choose the best answer (A–D).

### Back in time
As she stepped into the hall after nearly thirty years of absence, she realised at once that she shouldn't have come back. The smell of wood smoke, damp stone and ancient paper brought the past back so powerfully that it nearly knocked her backwards. In an instant she felt like a young girl again, alone and frightened in the house. She remembered feeling very, very cold – not from the damp and the near-freezing temperature, but because a terrible new life was beginning. And she could do nothing to stop it.

1 What is true about the woman's feelings when she entered the house?
A She realised that she had missed her old home.
B She was happy to return to the house.
C She understood that coming back was a mistake.
D She was sad about the condition of the house.

### Future home?
Every few years, trend-watchers tell us that the house of the future has arrived, and gadgets from science fiction films will soon be in every home in the country. So far they've been wrong – and after viewing the 'Home of the Future' exhibition, I suspect that they are still wrong. Why do I need a super-intelligent fridge or an internet-surfing mirror? I would much rather see my face clearly in an ordinary bathroom mirror than try to surf the Internet while I'm combing my hair! If only they could design a device to stop me killing all my houseplants. If they did that, then I might be interested!

2 What was the writer's reaction to the exhibition?
A He found it very interesting.
B It reminded him of a science fiction film.
C He wanted to buy the gadgets online.
D He didn't see the use of many of the inventions.
