The comparative and superlative forms of adjectives and adverbs with two syllables or more are formed by putting more or the most before the adjective or adverb.

Subject + verb | Comparative form | Object
Zoe is | (more +) intelligent, more intelligent, (more +) generous, more generous | than Toby.
Zoe writes | (more +) clearly, more clearly |

Subject + verb | Superlative form
Zoe is | (the + most +) generous, the most generous.
Zoe writes | (the + most +) clearly, the most clearly.

We can also form comparatives and superlatives of adjectives and adverbs with less and the least.

Less is the opposite of more. Least is the opposite of most.

Subject + verb | Comparative form | Object
Toby is | (less +) thin, less thin, (less +) intelligent, less intelligent | than Zoe.
Toby writes | (less +) clearly, less clearly |

Subject + verb | Superlative form
Toby is | (the + least +) generous, the least generous.
Toby writes | (the + least +) clearly, the least clearly.

We can use less and least with uncountable nouns.

We often use of after superlative adjectives.

But we use in, not of, with a group or place (e.g. the world, the class, London).

We can make comparisons with clauses as well as with nouns.

We often use a superlative with the present perfect and ever.

We can compare two things, using (not) as ... as.
Julie is as tall as Mike. (= They are the same height.)
Leah isn't as tall as Joe. (= Joe is taller.)

We use double comparatives to emphasise that something is changing.

We use the ... the and comparatives to say that one thing changes with another.

Remember irregular comparative and superlative forms.
