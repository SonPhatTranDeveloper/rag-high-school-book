BIO-PRINTING
It is already possible to 'print' three-dimensional objects out of plastic and metal using a 3-D printer. Now scientists are developing printers that will be able to print human organs and body parts. If they are successful, doctors could save millions of lives. At the moment, scientists are able to print human tissue and bone, but the printing of whole organs will probably be a reality by 2025. Doctors are certain that bio-printing will revolutionise the treatment of cancer and heart disease. Moreover, if we can produce organs such as hearts and kidneys, patients won't die while they're waiting for an organ donor. The technology is very expensive and the cost might not come down for a while. But when it does, bio-printing could play an important part in all our lives.

Some animals, like lizards and worms, have an amazing ability to grow new body parts if they lose them. Salamanders can grow new legs and some worms can re-grow every part of their body, including their head! If scientists ¹ ________ (can) discover how this happens, in theory it ² ________ (be) possible to re-grow human body parts too. Very few scientists are working on this problem now, but if governments ³ ________ (start) to spend more money on research, then this dream ⁴ ________ (become) a reality. Amazingly, some worms have no limit on lifespan, as they continually re-grow their bodies as they age. So if we ⁵ ________ (learn) to repair human limbs and organs, it ⁶ ________ (be) possible to prevent us from dying. But that is a long way in the future.
