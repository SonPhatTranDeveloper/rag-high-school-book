Review Unit 7

Reading

Read the article about a type of art. Are the sentences true or false? Write T or F.

When we think of art, we normally picture something which can exist for centuries. But there has always been a type of art which doesn't last. This is often referred to as 'temporary' art. Sculptures which are made of snow or ice, paintings in coloured sand, chalk drawings done on public pavements: it's not that these don't have artistic value, but they are designed to disappear.

Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada is a modern 'temporary' artist, and one who gets a lot of attention for his work. He uses groups of volunteers to help him, and his pieces take a long time to plan and create. But they are mostly talked about because the final results are so impressive. For the past few years, Rodriguez-Gerada has been creating gigantic faces in empty spaces in cities. To people on the ground, it looks like a garden, and it is hard to see any kind of design in it. In fact, GPS mapping is used to set out the design. Then an army of workers use this master plan to create the image which the artist has planned.

In 2014, the artist created an astonishing face on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It covered an area of 25,000 square metres, and it was created because the mall was getting new gardens, and the land wasn't going to be used for a while. The portrait was of a young man of mixed race, and was called Of the Many, One. The artist says that it showed one of the millions of faces that represent the American people. After a while, the sand and soil of the portrait were mixed together, and new lawns were planted in its place. The portrait has disappeared, but it will not easily be forgotten.
