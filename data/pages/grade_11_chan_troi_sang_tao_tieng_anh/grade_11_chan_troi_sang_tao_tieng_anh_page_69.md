6 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages if you have Ann Sullutor as a companion. Then share your ideas with the class. Which idea is the best?

Registered in the school system and equipped with an immense database, Ann can easily keep track of Nick's schedule and curriculum. During class, Ann gives off a warning beep when Nick is distracted, quickly converts the new material into braille or dictates what the teacher has just written on board. Ann is there to bridge the gap between Nick and his classmates. In Nick's individual sessions, Ann suggests lessons depending on his preference and ability. She can adapt the lesson to aid Nick's learning process, but she doesn't jump in immediately to offer him a hand. Nick has to work on his own for a while before Ann makes a few suggestions. She may even ask Nick to read some extra materials to get a grasp of the topic. Nick often complains about Ann's persistence and strictness. In his fury, Nick sometimes does wish to turn Ann off for a while, which can only be done by his parents.

Ann Sullutor is much more than a beautifully-designed gadget for a visually-impaired child. She can make a perfect companion to any child that needs a tutor or a friend to talk with.
