To: anna@email.com

Hi Anna,
Hope everything is OK with you. We've just moved to a new flat nearer the centre of town. It's brilliant being so close to the shops, and the flat is bigger than our old one. It's quite noisy, though, as there is a lot of traffic. I'd rather it was further from the main road. I met one of our neighbours yesterday. She is about my age and she is very friendly. She has invited me to a party next weekend. Can you go with me? I hope so. To be honest, I'd rather not go alone. Also, would it be OK if I used your bike for a few days? Mine is at the bike shop and I'd rather cycle to school than get the bus.
Got to go now. I'd better finish my homework before bed. I look forward to receiving your reply.
Love,
Ellie
