6.3 Indirect questions

We make indirect questions with phrases like Can you tell me ...? and Do you know ...? We use them to sound more polite in formal situations.
Excuse me. Do you know where the bank is, please?

To make a yes / no question into an indirect question, we use if or whether.
Could you tell me if the film has started yet?
May I ask whether this seat is free?

To make a wh- question into an indirect question, we use the question word.
Would you mind telling me what time it is?

The word order and verb forms in an indirect question are the same as in an affirmative statement.
Could you tell me if there is a train to London after ten this evening?

1 Rewrite the questions as indirect questions. Use the phrases in brackets.
1 Where is the post office? (Could you tell me)
2 Do you have any mayonnaise? (I was wondering)
3 What time does the film finish? (I'd like to know)
4 What is your name? (May I ask)
5 What is the salary for this job? (I'd be interested to know)

We form the passive with the verb be + the past participle.

Tense | Passive form
--- | ---
present simple | Tyres are made of rubber.
present continuous | A new school is being built.

past continuous | I felt that I was being watched.
present perfect | My watch has been stolen.
past perfect | The money had been lost earlier.

After modal verbs, we use a passive infinitive.
