LEARN THIS! Participle and infinitive clauses
a We use participle or infinitive clauses to give more information about a noun. You can think of them as shortened relative clauses.

b Participle clauses can begin with a present participle (-ing form). The participle replaces an active verb of any tense, including stative verbs.
I saw a man wearing (= who was wearing) a space suit.

c Participle clauses can also begin with a past participle. The participle replaces a passive verb of any tense.
We lived in a large house, built (= which had been built) in the 17th century.

d Infinitive clauses begin with an infinitive which replaces an active or passive verb.
Mark became the first teenage runner to finish (= who finished) the city marathon.
I still have a few jobs to do (= that have to be done) this afternoon.

PART 1
Apollo 13, launched from Florida on 11 April 1970, was the third Apollo mission to land on the moon. The three astronauts chosen for the mission were James Lovell, Fred Haise and John Swigert. The launch, watched by millions on TV, went smoothly and for the first two days in space, everything went well. The crew gave a 49-minute TV interview explaining how they lived and worked in zero gravity. However, nine minutes after the interview finished, a tank containing oxygen exploded and John Swigert, noticing a red warning light, said the famous words: 'Houston, we've had a problem here.' They checked all their equipment and realised that they were running out of water, power and oxygen - hard and fast. They were in a damaged spaceship floating 320,000 kilometres from Earth.

PART 2
The astronauts left the main part of the spaceship and went inside the lunar module, which had been fitted with its own oxygen tank. But inside the smaller module, which was designed to hold only two people, carbon dioxide levels started rising. The astronauts, who had been following instructions from the ground crew, made air filters out of plastic bags and cardboard. Then they waited in the cold and dark while the ground crew, who were working 24 hours a day, tried to work out a way to bring them home. If some people in America were losing interest in the Space Program, the Apollo 13 crisis, which was discussed on all the TV news programmes, changed all that. The astronauts who were risking their lives and the people who were trying to save them all became national heroes - especially when Apollo 13 returned safely to Earth with all three astronauts alive.
