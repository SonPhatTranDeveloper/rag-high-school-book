4B Grammar
Comparison
I can make comparisons using a variety of structures.

1 SPEAKING Describe the photo. What are the people doing? What might they be saying?

2 Read the dialogue, ignoring the gaps, and check your ideas from exercise 1.

Jenny I think this flat is the best we've seen so far. Rents seem to be getting higher and higher. But this one's the least expensive and it's the 1_______ (near) to the city centre.

Beth But it's the one with the fewest rooms and the least space.

Jenny So you prefer the flat in the 2_______ (bad) location and with the 3_______ (high) rent?

Beth The location isn't that bad. It's 4_______ (far) from the centre than the other two, but you can get to the train station more easily. And it's much 5_______ (spacious) than the other two flats.

Jenny Can we afford it, though? The more we spend on rent, the less we'll have for other things.

Beth Actually, it's less expensive than it seems because the rent includes all the bills.

3 Complete the dialogue with the comparative or superlative form of the adjectives in brackets.

4 Read the Learn this! box. Match each highlighted phrase in the dialogue with a rule (a–f).

4 As the flat gets older, it becomes more dilapidated. (the)

7 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Ask and answer using a superlative form (-est / most / least) and the present perfect with ever.

1 Impressive building / visit
2 Interesting person / know
3 Long book / read
4 Exciting film / see

What's the most impressive building you've ever visited?

LEARN THIS! Comparative and superlative forms

a We often use a superlative with the present perfect.
   That's the biggest mansion I've ever seen.

b We use double comparatives to emphasise that something is changing.
   Property is getting cheaper and cheaper.

c We use The ..., the ... and comparatives to say that one thing changes with another.
   The closer you are to the centre, the more you pay in rent.

d We usually use more and most to form comparative and superlative adverbs. However, we add -er and -est to some short adverbs.
   The flat sold more quickly than I expected.
   Houses sell faster in the spring.

e Like more and most, we can use less and least with long adjectives, adverbs and uncountable nouns.
   This is the least spacious house in the road.
   There's less space in my room than in yours.

f We use fewer and fewest with countable nouns.
   Which flat has the fewest rooms?
   There are fewer big flats in the town centre.
