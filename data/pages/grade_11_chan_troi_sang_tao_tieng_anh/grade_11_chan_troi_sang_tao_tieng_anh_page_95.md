7H Writing
A school magazine entry
I can write about my favourite book.

1 SPEAKING Work in pairs. What was the last book you read? What was it about? Did you enjoy it? Why / Why not?

Your teacher has asked you to write an entry for the school magazine. Describe the book and say why you liked it.

2 Read the task above and the entry. Did the writer enjoy the book? Did he / she have any reservations?

Writing Strategy 1
1 In the first paragraph, attract the reader's attention. You can do this by addressing him / her directly, especially with questions.
2 Use an appropriate style for the target audience.
3 Choose a good title for your entry.

3 Read Writing Strategy 1 and the sample and check.
- Does the writer address the readers directly?
- Is the style formal or informal?
- Which title is better?
1 My favourite book: The Hunger Games
2 This is probably one of the best books that I have ever read

Writing Strategy 2
1 Give your entry a logical structure. Divide it into paragraphs, each with its own focus.
2 The conclusion should restate the main idea given in the introduction, but using different words. It should also include a recommendation.

4 Read Writing Strategy 2. In which paragraph (A–D) does the writer
1 describe the plot and characters?
2 mention something he / she liked?
3 give some background information about the book?
4 recommend the book?

5 Which tense does the writer use to describe the plot and characters?

A Have you ever read a book that you just couldn't put down? The Hunger Games was like that for me. It's that good! Written by Suzanne Collins in 2006, it's sold millions of copies around the world and has been made into a film.

B It's set in the future in a place called Panem and it tells the story of Katniss, a sixteen-year-old girl who competes in the Hunger Games with eleven other children. Only one child can survive the games, and Katniss is not optimistic about her chances. There are lots of twists and turns along the way.

C What I love about the book is the character of Katniss. She's really strong and sensitive. She is practical-minded and loves freedom. She is also quick at getting the information and memorising things. I really identify with her. The story is very gripping. It is hard to put the book down once you start reading it.

D All in all, this book is a real page-turner. I absolutely love it and I'd definitely recommend it. So if you haven't read it yet, buy it or borrow it. You won't be disappointed.
