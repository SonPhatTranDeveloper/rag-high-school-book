Unit 1
1.1 Past tense contrast

We use past tenses to talk about past events. We use the past continuous to describe a scene in the past. The events were in progress at the same time.
The sun was shining. A man was standing at the bus stop waiting for a bus.

We use the past simple for actions or events that happened one after the other.
Tom got up, had a shower and got dressed.

We use the past continuous to describe a longer background event, and the past simple to describe an action or event that interrupted it.
The phone rang while we were having dinner.

We use the past perfect to talk about an event that happened before another event in the past.
I didn't have any money because I'd lost my wallet.

Notice that with regular verbs the past simple and the past participle form of the past perfect are the same.
She arrived yesterday night.
She had arrived before we served the dinner.

However, with irregular verbs the past simple and the past participle form of the past perfect are often different.
I ate an apple.     I'd already eaten.
