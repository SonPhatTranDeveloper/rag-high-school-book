Unit 8

8.1 The third conditional

We form the third conditional with if + past perfect, would have + past participle.

If you'd gone to bed earlier, you wouldn't have fallen asleep in class.

We use the third conditional to talk about imaginary situations and to say how things could have been different in the past.

If we'd left earlier, we wouldn't have missed the train.

We often use if to express regret or criticism.

If you'd been more careful, you wouldn't have dropped those plates.
You would have passed your exams if you'd worked a bit harder.

We can also put the if clause at the end of the sentence.

I'd have invited you if I'd known you liked fancy-dress parties.
