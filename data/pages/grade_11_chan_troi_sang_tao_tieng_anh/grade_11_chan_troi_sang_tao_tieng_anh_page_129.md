Notice the short forms used in third conditional sentences. The short form of both had and would is 'd.
If I'd had more money, I'd have paid for you.

In spoken English, we often shorten both would and have in the main clause. However, in written English, we don't usually shorten both forms.

Spoken:
If I hadn't run out of petrol, I'd've come by car.

Written:
If I hadn't run out of petrol, I'd have come by car.

1 Write third conditional sentences. Use the verbs in brackets.
1 If I ______________ (drive) faster, we ______________ (arrive) before six.
2 If Mary ______________ (get) to the cinema earlier, she ______________ (see) the start of the film.
3 You ______________ (know) what to do if you ______________ (listen) to the instructions.
4 You ______________ (not cut) yourself if you ______________ (not be) so careless with the knife.
5 If I ______________ (have) the time, I ______________ (call) you.
6 I ______________ (not get) angry if you ______________ (not be) so rude!
7 Do you think you ______________ (pass) your exams if you ______________ (work) harder?

2 Rewrite the two sentences as one. Use the third conditional.
1 You didn't go to bed early. You were tired the following morning.
If you'd gone to bed early, you wouldn't have been tired the following morning.
2 Emma didn't catch the bus. She had to walk to school.
3 The tickets were expensive. I didn't travel by plane.
4 I ate too much. I felt ill.
5 I spent all my money. I was broke.
6 I took a painkiller. My headache went away.
7 We didn't save a lot of money. We weren't able to buy a new car.

8.2 Participle clauses

We use participle clauses to give more information about a noun. They can be described as shortened relative clauses (defining or non-defining).

Defining:
A woman wearing a yellow T-shirt ran out of the shop. (= who was wearing a yellow T-shirt)

Non-defining:
Her uncle, looking anxious, was standing on the pavement. (= who was looking anxious)

Participle clauses can begin with either a present participle (-ing form) or past participle. Clauses with a present participle (-ing form) replace an active verb. The verb they replace can be in any tense.
Outside the caf√©, there was a man selling postcards. (= who was selling postcards)
She gave me a box containing some old letters. (= which contained some old letters)

Clauses with a past participle replace a passive verb. The verb they replace can be in any tense.
A Roman vase found in France last year is being sold. (= which was found in France last year)

1 Rewrite the sentences using participle clauses to replace the relative clauses.
1 I saw three men who were arguing about a taxi.
I saw three men arguing about a taxi.
2 We talked to a young man who wanted to study in England.
3 A suspected burglar, who had been arrested by the police, has escaped.
4 My uncle bought a pen that was made of gold.
5 She was wearing a necklace that belonged to her grandmother.
6 Three men, who were coming out of the restaurant late at night, saw the robbery.

8.3 Reply questions

We use a reply question to respond to a statement. They express interest or surprise.
'I've bought a new bike.'
'Have you? How could you afford it?'

We use the verb be, auxiliary verbs (do, have), or modal verbs (will, would, etc.), depending on the tense and verb form in the statement.
'He hasn't seen that film.'
'Hasn't he? Well, let's rent it, then.'
'I hate cats.'
'Do you? I thought you liked them.'

Tense | Statement | Reply question
Present simple | I like dogs. | Do you?
Present continuous | He's eating. | Is he?
Past simple | She broke her arm. | Did she?
Present perfect | It's finished. | Has it?
Past perfect | They hadn't met. | Hadn't they?
can | She can't swim. | Can't she?
will | She won't forget. | Won't she?
would | He'd enjoy skiing. | Would he?
