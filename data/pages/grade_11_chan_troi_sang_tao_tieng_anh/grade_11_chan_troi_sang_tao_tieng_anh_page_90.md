I can use the structure 'have something done'.

1 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Look at the photo. Do you like the tattoo? Is it a form of art? Does it tell you anything about the woman's personality or not?

2 Read the article. Why do some people think it is necessary to hide their tattoos when they have an interview?

Amanda recently had a colourful butterfly tattooed on her wrist. Brad had the names of his two daughters tattooed on his neck under his hair. His friend Doug had his back decorated with a large tattoo of a shield. For the people themselves, these examples of body art are meaningful and important. Nevertheless, they deliberately had them done in places that can easily be hidden. Why? Because they want to give themselves the best possible chance of getting a job, and many employers have a negative attitude towards tattoos and other forms of body art (piercings, body painting, etc.). That is because many employers do not think that decorating yourself with tattoos is acceptable. But when these employers were young themselves, back in the 1980s, they probably had their hair dyed a bright colour to shock their parents! Fashions change, but younger generations always have the desire to be different.
