The passive
I can identify and use different forms of the passive.

Real or fake?
News reader: Artist Wolfgang Beltracchi has made millions of pounds from his paintings. However, many of the paintings are not signed with his own name, but with the names of other famous painters. He is the world's most successful forger, and has fooled the art world for over thirty years. Our reporter Jade Quinn has been investigating. How was he finally caught, Jade?

JQ: He used the wrong kind of paint in a forgery of a Campendonk painting. The painting had been bought by a company who sent it to a forensic art scientist in London. He identified a type of paint which wasn't being used when Campendonk was alive.

NR: That was careless! What happened to Beltracchi?

JQ: He was prosecuted and sent to prison for six years.

NR: Fifty-eight of his paintings have been identified by police as forgeries and several more are being examined by experts. Are there any more?

JQ: Beltracchi himself claims that he has forged hundreds of paintings, but he won't say which ones, so they might never be discovered.

NR: What has he done with the money he earned from the forgeries?

JQ: He's spent a lot of it, but some of it will be returned to the people who bought his forgeries.

NR: Does he still paint in the style of famous artists?

JQ: Yes, but now he signs the paintings with his own name.
