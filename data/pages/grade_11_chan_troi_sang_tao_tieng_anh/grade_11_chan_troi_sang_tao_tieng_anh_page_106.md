# 8G Speaking

## Guided conversation

I can have a conversation about holiday plans.

### LEARN THIS! Reply questions and question tags

a In reply questions and question tags, we use auxiliary verbs (do, have, would, etc.) or the verb be.

b We can use reply questions to respond to a statement. They express interest or surprise. Reply questions usually get a rising intonation.
'We're nearly at the hotel.' 'Are we?'
'You didn't tell me.' 'Didn't I?'

c We can use a question tag when we want somebody to confirm what we are saying. Question tags to confirm usually get a falling intonation.
'You booked the hotel, didn't you?'
'We aren't lost, are we?'
