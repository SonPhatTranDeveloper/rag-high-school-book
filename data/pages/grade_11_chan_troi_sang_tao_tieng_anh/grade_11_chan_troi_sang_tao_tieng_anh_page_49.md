# Review Unit 3

## Reading

1 Read extracts 1 and 2 below, which have missing sentences. Try to predict what each missing sentence is about. Then look at Aâ€“D and choose the sentences that are closest to your prediction.

1 Be careful when you choose a leisure activity because some activities take up a lot of time or effort. _____ Find out what an activity needs before you begin, and you won't have wasted your time.
2 If you think you have hurt yourself while exercising, stop immediately. _____ As a result, they end up with worse injuries, so it takes them much longer to get better.

A This is important if a doctor has told you to rest.
B This means that you may become discouraged and give up because it is too demanding.
C Too many people try to continue, despite the pain.
D Then they find that it doesn't interest them as much as they thought it would.

2 Read the text. Five sentences have been removed. Choose the correct sentences (Aâ€“G) to fill the gaps (1â€“5). There are two extra sentences.

Hobbies and leisure activities are an ideal way to destress, meet people and develop your creativity. But if you don't have a lot of spare time, it can be a challenge to find one that suits your tastes and fits into your busy life. Of course, some readers ask why they should take up a hobby at all. 1_____ They don't realise that being more active and doing something really enjoyable can improve their energy levels and their mood.

One strategy for finding the right leisure activity is to think about what you enjoyed when you were a young child. 2_____ Now here's your chance to try again. Perhaps you wish you could spend time exploring on your bicycle again, or wonder why you stopped drawing cartoons. Think about going back to similar activities.

Another approach is to think about the hobbies your friends have taken up. 3_____ Training together will give both of you a boost in motivation. Or if you see a friend's paintings and you fancy doing some painting as well, give it a try. Something to keep in mind is that an activity may not interest you after you've tried it. 4_____ So don't beg your parents to pay for a lot of equipment or a whole year's lessons right away. Begin slowly, borrow what you need, and see if the activity is really right for you. If you still enjoy an activity after a few weeks of starting it, it might be the right hobby for you. 5_____ And if you complete it, perhaps you can ask for some equipment for your next birthday present.
