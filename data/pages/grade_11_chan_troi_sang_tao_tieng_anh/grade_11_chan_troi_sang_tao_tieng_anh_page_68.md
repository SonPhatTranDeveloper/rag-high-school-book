1 SPEAKING Read the conversation between a human and a computer, guess which is the human.

2 Now scan the article. Which of the following is the main idea?
a Ann Sullutor – a typical day at work
b Ann Sullutor – a multitasking companion

3 Read the Reading Strategy. Then complete these tasks.
1 Look at question 1 in exercise 4. Read the second paragraph of the text.
2 Circle the correct option and identify the sentence of the paragraph which gives the answer.
3 Which words are used in the sentence instead of the words in the correct option?

### Reading Strategy
In a multiple-choice question, the correct option will match the meaning of the text but use different words. It is therefore important not to automatically assume that a multiple-choice option which contains words from the text is correct.

# A perfect companion

A: You don't know what you want to study?! Lazy humans!
B: Say what I need to study.
A: You have not yet told me what you want to study.

This conversation is between a visually-impaired student, Nick, and his digital tutor named Ann Sullutor.

Ann Sullutor is the brainchild of a 22nd century scientist modelled on and named after the dedicated tutor of Helen Keller. You can have conversations with Ann Sullutor via a wristwatch or any piece of jewellery. The idea of the digital tutor was to help disabled children study in mainstream schools.

Early in the morning, Ann Sullutor wakes up from a full charge of energy, ready for a 20-hour non-stop working day. Nick is quite independent in familiar situations, but if he comes across something unexpected, he can turn to Ann Sullutor for help by using his voice to control the watch on this wrist. Similarly, if he is in an unfamiliar place, he can get directions from Ann through a tiny set of earphones. In an emergency, for example, if there is an obstacle or unexpected vehicle, Nick receives a tiny vibration as a warning. Ann sends reports to the child's parents on a regular basis or on demand.
