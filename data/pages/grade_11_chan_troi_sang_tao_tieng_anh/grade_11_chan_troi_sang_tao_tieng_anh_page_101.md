Travel solutions
I can identify the context of a conversation and its register.

1 Read the text. Find the name of the inventor and the invention.

As air travel becomes more and more popular, simply getting to the airport can be a challenging and unpleasant experience. You pay a fortune to park your car, then you have to walk for hours with heavy suitcases to arrive at the terminal. Well, a farmer from China called He Liang has come up with an idea which solves both problems: a suitcase that you can ride like a motorbike. He has called it the City Cab. It is powered by a battery and can travel up to 60 km at a speed of 20 km/h. And, of course, you don't need to find a car park for the City Cab - you just drive into the airport terminal and check it in!

Listening Strategy 1
It is sometimes difficult to catch names and proper nouns when you listen. However, you can use the words around them (including collocations) to work out what they are (a person, a place, etc.). For example, if you hear 'We stayed four nights at the Grand Plaza', the underlined words tell you that the Grand Plaza is a hotel.

2 a tuk-tuk?             5 Damian Fairchild?

adjacent to (next to) due to (because of) prior to (before) beverages (drinks) to commence (to begin) to depart (to leave) to proceed to (to go to) to purchase (to buy) refreshments (food and drink) to terminate (to end)
