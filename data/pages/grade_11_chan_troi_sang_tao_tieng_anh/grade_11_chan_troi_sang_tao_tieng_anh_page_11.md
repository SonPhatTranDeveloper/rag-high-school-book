a Dynamic verbs describe actions and can be used in the simple or continuous form.
b Stative verbs describe states or situations and are not usually used in continuous tenses. Common stative verbs include:

d However, some stative verbs and linking verbs can sometimes be used in the continuous form to describe a temporary situation:
