# Unit 2

2 Work in pairs. Are there any rules in your family or things that you or your parents think are necessary? Share them with your partner. Use must, have to, and should.

Example:
A: I have to be back home by 9 p.m.
B: Really? I don't have to. But my parents think I shouldn't stay out after 10 p.m.

## III READING

Different generations

1 Work in pairs. Look at the photos. Discuss what you know about the generation in each picture (e.g. age, characteristics, interests, life experiences).

2 Read the article. Match the highlighted words with their meanings.

Over the past two centuries, different generations were born and given different names. Each generation comes with its characteristics, which are largely influenced by the historical, economic, and social conditions of the country they live in. However, in many countries the following three generations have common characteristics.

Generation X refers to the generation born between 1965 and 1980. When Gen Xers grew up, they experienced many social changes and developments in history. As a result, they are always ready for changes and prepared to work through changes. Gen Xers are also known as critical thinkers because they achieved higher levels of education than previous generations.

Generation Y, also known as Millennials, refers to those born between the early 1980s and late 1990s. They are curious and ready to accept changes. If there is a faster, better way of doing something, Millennials want to try it out. They also value teamwork. When working in a team, Millennials welcome different points of view and ideas from others.

Generation Z includes people born between the late 1990s and early 2010s, a time of great technological developments and changes. That is why Gen Zers are also called digital natives. They grew up online and never knew the world before digital and social media. They are very creative and able to experiment with platforms to suit their needs. Many Gen Zers are also interested in starting their own businesses and companies. They saw so many people lose their jobs, so they think it is safer to be your own boss than relying on someone else to hire you.

Soon a new generation, labelled Gen Alpha, will be on the scene. Let's wait and see if we will notice the generation gap.
