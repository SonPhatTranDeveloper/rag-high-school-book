PRESERVING HERITAGE AROUND THE WORLD

Crowdfunding for heritage!
Preserving their heritage can present a challenge to many nations, especially if they have a large number of heritage sites, like Italy does. However, the country has found a new method of raising money for heritage projects from a large number of individuals and businesses - crowdfunding. For example, loveitaly, a non-profit organisation, uses its website to reach all the people around the world who love Italy, and collects donations from everyone who wants to help. One of their first success stories was raising enough money to restore an ancient site in Pompeii.

Strict heritage laws
In Australia, individuals and companies have to pay a fine of AU$1,000 to AU$5,000 for any damage to heritage sites or objects, regardless of whether they can be repaired. In some cases, the fines are heavier, and people could even face time in prison. The authorities hope the harsher punishments can stop people from destroying or damaging cultural sites and items, and prevent heritage crime.

Tourism works!
Spain is one of the countries that has successfully promoted its cultural heritage through tourism. For many years, festivals such as La Tomatina (in which people throw tomatoes at each other) or Las Fallas (a five-day festival of fireworks and light shows) in Valencia have attracted millions of local and foreign tourists. The unique architecture in Barcelona, home to nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and Santiago de Compostela's Old Town, which is also on the world heritage list, are famous all over the world.
