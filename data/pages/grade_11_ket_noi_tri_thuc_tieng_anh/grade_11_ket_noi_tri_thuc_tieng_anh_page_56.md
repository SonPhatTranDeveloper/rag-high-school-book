The UN Climate Change Conference

1 Work in pairs. Look at the pictures and discuss the environmental problems you see.

2 Read the article and choose the best title for it.

In 1994, the UN decided to bring together world leaders for an annual event, known as COP or 'Conference of Parties', to discuss climate change. This year's conference will review what has been achieved and discuss the key goals.

The first goal is to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. This will require reducing global CO2 emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, and by 2050 achieving a balance between the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere and those removed from it.

The second goal is to reduce the use of coal, which is the dirtiest fuel and biggest source of planet-warming CO2 emissions. Countries will have to stop building new coal plants and switch to clean sources of energy.

The third goal is to end deforestation. Forests remove CO2 from the atmosphere and slow global warming. But when they are cut down or burnt, they release the carbon stored in the trees into the atmosphere as CO2. Stopping deforestation is, therefore, an effective solution to climate change.

The last key goal is to reduce methane emissions. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is more powerful than CO2 at warming the earth. It is responsible for nearly one-third of current warming from human activities. Methane comes from farming activities and landfill waste. The production and use of coal, oil, and natural gas also release methane.

This conference is very important because this is the best last chance we have to slow global warming. World leaders, climate experts, organisations, and national representatives will carefully discuss these goals and agree on how to make global progress on climate change.
