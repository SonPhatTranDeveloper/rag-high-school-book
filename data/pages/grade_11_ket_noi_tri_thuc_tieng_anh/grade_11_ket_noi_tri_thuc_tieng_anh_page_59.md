A leaflet about ways to reduce black carbon emissions

1 Work in pairs. Match the ways to reduce black carbon emissions (1-3) with the reasons (a-i) for doing so.

1 Stop burning waste
2 Stop using solid fuels at home
3 Switch to renewable energy

a) Soot from open waste burning has a strong warming effect on the earth.
b) Renewable energy is clean, so it doesn't pollute the environment.
c) The burning of waste in open fires is bad for the environment.
d) The burning of organic waste produces nearly one-third of global black carbon emissions.
e) Fossil fuels will be used up in this century while renewable energy will never run out because it comes from natural sources.
f) Household air pollution kills millions of people yearly.
g) Used for cooking or heating, solid fuels like coal and wood release black carbon and other pollutants.
h) Renewable energy can replace fossil fuels because it is convenient and reliable.
i) The tiny pieces of black carbon released from indoor stoves can enter the human body and cause serious health problems.

What's wrong with burning waste?
The burning of rubbish and organic waste in open fires is very bad for the environment. It produces nearly a third of global black carbon emissions. Soot from open waste burning has a strong warming effect on the earth. It warms the earth by trapping sunlight and releasing it as heat. It is one of the main causes of global warming.
Ban open waste burning!

Use soot-free fuels!

Renewable energy is the future!

Power the planet with renewable energy!
