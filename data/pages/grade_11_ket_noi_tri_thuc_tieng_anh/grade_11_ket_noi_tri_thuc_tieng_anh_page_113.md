Grammar
Compound nouns

Remember!
A compound noun is a noun that is made with two or more words, e.g. air-traffic controller.
A compound noun is usually formed by:
• noun + noun: bus stop
• adjective + noun: wildlife
• -ing form + noun: washing machine
• noun + -ing form: film-making
• verb + preposition: break-out

Some compound nouns are usually written as one word, e.g. bedroom, some as separate words, e.g. tennis shoes, and others with a hyphen, e.g. film-maker.

Even if the first noun has a plural meaning, it usually has a singular form, e.g. car park.

To make a compound noun plural, we usually make the second noun plural, e.g. car parks. There are some exceptions, e.g. clothes shop, passers-by.
