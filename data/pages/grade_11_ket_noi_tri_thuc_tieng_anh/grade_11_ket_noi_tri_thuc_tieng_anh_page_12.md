Life expectancy has generally increased over the past few decades, and some people enjoy a longer and healthier life than others. One possible explanation is that they have healthy lifestyle habits. So how can you develop these habits?

A.
Start by looking at food labels, paying attention to ingredients and nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals. Avoid having food with too much salt or sugar, such as fast food. Furthermore, add more fresh fruits and vegetables to your diet, and remember to eat a big breakfast and a small dinner.

B.
If you have not been very active, start exercising slowly, but regularly. To begin with, choose the type of exercise that is suitable for you. Then, start slowly, for example, by doing exercise for only 5 to 10 minutes a day. When your body is ready for more exercise, you can work out longer. Finally, exercise regularly to always keep your body fit and your mind happy.

C.
A good night's sleep is very important. Before you go to bed, avoid having coffee or energy drinks. Exercise can help you have a better sleep, but avoid exercising right before bedtime. Never use your mobile phone or laptop in bed and turn off all your electronic devices at least 30 minutes before you go to bed. Their screens give off blue light that can prevent you from sleeping well. Finally, if you still can't fall asleep, do something repetitive or listen to some soft music to relax before trying to sleep again.
