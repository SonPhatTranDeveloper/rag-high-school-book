Unit 6

Tips
• To keep a conversation going, you should show that you are interested in it and encourage the speaker to continue speaking using words and phrases such as Yeah, Uh huh, OK, Right, I see, Interesting, Really.
• We often need to think before speaking. To show that you have understood and are going to speak, use words and phrases such as Well, Let me think, I'm not sure, Hold on a minute, That's a good question.

3 Work in pairs. Make a similar conversation about ways to preserve cultural heritage. Use the ideas in 1, the model in 2, and the tips above to help you.

4 Work in groups. Think of a form of cultural heritage (such as a tradition, a festival, or a form of music), and discuss ways to preserve it. Report your group's ideas to the whole class.
