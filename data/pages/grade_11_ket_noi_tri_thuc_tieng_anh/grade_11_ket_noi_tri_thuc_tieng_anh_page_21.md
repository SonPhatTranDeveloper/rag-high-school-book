Grammar

Modal verbs: must, have to, and should

Remember!

• We use must and have to to say it is necessary to do something at present.
  Example: Oh, it's 10 p.m. I must go home now./I have to go home now.
• We use have to to talk about the past or future.
  Example: My grandmother had to do all household chores.
           We will have to accept these generational differences.
• When the speaker decides what is necessary, we use must. When someone else makes the
  decision, we use have to.
  Example: I must clean my room before my friend comes to stay with me.
           I have to clean my room every day. (My mother forces me to do it.)
• We use mustn't to express something we are not allowed to do.
  Example: You mustn't behave rudely towards other people.
• We use don't have to to say that something is not necessary.
  Example: They don't have to wear uniforms at the weekend.
• We use should or shouldn't to give advice, make a recommendation, or offer an opinion
  about what is right or wrong.
