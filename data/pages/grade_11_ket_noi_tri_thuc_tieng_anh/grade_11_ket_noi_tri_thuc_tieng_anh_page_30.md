# II LANGUAGE

## Pronunciation

### Linking final consonants to initial vowels

#### Remember!
- When we speak naturally, we don't pause between most words. We usually link the end and beginning of some words so that they are easy to say and flow together smoothly.
- Consonant-to-vowel linking is very common and occurs between a word ending with a consonant sound and a word beginning with a vowel sound.

1. He lives in the city centre.
2. Cities of the future will be more exciting.
3. The new high-rise building is in the west of the city.
4. A lot of people come to the city to walk across the famous bridge.

### 2 Listen and mark (__) the consonant and vowel sounds that are linked. Then practise saying the sentences.
