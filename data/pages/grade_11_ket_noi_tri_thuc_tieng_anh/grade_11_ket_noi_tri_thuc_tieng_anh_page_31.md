Grammar
Stative verbs in the continuous form

Remember!

Stative verbs describe a state rather than an action.
They often refer to thoughts and opinions (e.g. agree, believe, remember, think, understand), feelings and emotions (e.g. hate, love, prefer), senses (e.g. appear, feel, hear, look, see, seem, smell, taste) and possession (e.g. belong, have, own).

They are not normally used in the continuous form. However, some stative verbs can be used in the continuous form to describe actions, depending on the context.

Example: My dad has a new car.
          He is having a good time.
