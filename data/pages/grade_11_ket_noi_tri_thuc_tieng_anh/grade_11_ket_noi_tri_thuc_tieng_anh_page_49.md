1 Read the following proposal and match the headings (1-4) with the paragraphs (A-D).

Title: VIETNAMESE TRADITIONAL GAMES FESTIVAL
To: The Head teacher of Ha Noi High School
Date: 10 January
Prepared by: Youth Union

A.
Next month, a group of students from ASEAN countries will visit our school. We put out a call for ideas for activities to welcome our guests. One of the best ideas is holding a Vietnamese Traditional Games Festival.

B.
The event will take place in the school stadium. It will start at 9 a.m. and will last for three hours. The event will be hosted by grade 11 students, who will make all the arrangements for the activities. These will include Vietnamese traditional games such as bamboo dancing, tug of war, and stilt walking.

C.
The event will help our guests learn about our culture by watching and playing Vietnamese traditional games. Taking part in fun games is also the best way to break the ice, make friends and create bonds with people.

D.
We really hope you will consider this proposal as we think that it will be beneficial to both local students and guests.

2. Conclusion
