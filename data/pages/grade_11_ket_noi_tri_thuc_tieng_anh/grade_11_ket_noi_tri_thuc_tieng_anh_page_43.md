I. GETTING STARTED
At the ASEAN Youth Volunteer Programme (AYVP) office

1. Listen and read.
Mai: Good afternoon. My name's Mai Nguyen. Are you Ms Pang? You replied to my email and invited me to visit your office.
Ms Pang: Yes, I'm Ms Pang. It's nice to meet you, Mai. So how did you hear about us?
Mai: My cousin was an AYVP volunteer. He often said taking part in the programme was an experience he would never forget.
Ms Pang: Glad to hear that. The main goals of AYVP are promoting youth volunteering and helping the development of the ASEAN community.
Mai: What can I do to prepare for the programme?
Ms Pang: Well, to become an AYVP volunteer, you must be qualified for the programme, and this depends on the themes for the year.
Mai: What are the areas covered by AYVP?
Ms Pang: There are eight themes. I suggest checking our website to find out this year's themes.
Mai: How are volunteers selected?
Ms Pang: To be selected, you should be over 18. Then you may need to propose a community project related to the theme. And we'll probably interview you to make sure you speak English well and are very keen on participating in the programme.
Mai: That doesn't sound too difficult. Thanks so much for meeting me.
Ms Pang: You're welcome.
