# I. GETTING STARTED

## Planning our education

1. Listen and read.

**Ms Hoa:** Good morning, class. There was an education fair last weekend. Did anyone go?

**Nam:** Yes, Mai and I did. The fair was great, and we got a lot of useful information.

**Ms Hoa:** I'm glad to hear that. Would you like to share some of it with the class?

**Mai:** Sure. After finishing school, we mainly have two education options. For example, we can get into university if we earn high grades or pass the university entrance exam.

**Nam:** That's true, but academic education isn't everything. The other option is going to a vocational school where we can learn skills for particular jobs.

**Ms Hoa:** That sounds interesting. So what are your plans for the future?

**Mai:** I'm hoping to go to university. Having won several biology competitions, I want to study biology and become a scientist.

**Ms Hoa:** Great! It's really important to follow your dream, Mai. My mum still regrets not having gone to university. So I want to make her proud of me. How about you, Nam?

**Nam:** Well, I don't think university is for me. I want to go to a vocational school because I want to become a car mechanic. My father owns a car repair shop. Having watched him work very hard for many years helped me make my decision.

**Ms Hoa:** That's very sensible, Nam! I hope you can help him grow his business.
