Grammar

Cleft sentences with It is/was ... that/who ...

Remember!

• A cleft sentence is used to focus on a particular part of the sentence and to emphasise what we want to say.
• We use preparatory It to introduce the thing that we want to focus on while the rest is put in a relative clause introduced with a relative pronoun, e.g. that or who.
Example:
Nam taught Mai how to use the app in the library last weekend. (no particular focus)
- It was Nam that/who taught Mai how to use the app in the library last weekend. (focus on Nam)
- It was the app that Nam taught Mai how to use in the library last weekend. (focus on the app)
- It was in the library that Nam taught Mai how to use the app last weekend. (focus on the library)
- It was last weekend that Nam taught Mai how to use the app in the library. (focus on last weekend)
