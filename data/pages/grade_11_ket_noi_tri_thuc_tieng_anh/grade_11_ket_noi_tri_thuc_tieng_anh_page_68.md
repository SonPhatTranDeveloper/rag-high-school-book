# II LANGUAGE

## Pronunciation

### Intonation in statements, commands, and lists

Remember!
- Intonation describes how a speaker's voice rises and falls in speech, and is very important in communication.
- We usually use falling intonation at the end of statements and commands to show certainty.
- When listing things, we slightly raise our voice on each item (level-rising intonation) and lower our voice on the last item to show that the list is complete.

# 1 Listen and repeat. Pay attention to the falling intonation (↘) and level-rising intonation (↗) in the following sentences.

1. Our class is going on a field trip next week.↘
2. Put your rubbish in the bin!↘
3. You can see beautiful caves↗, green valleys↗, and high mountains.↘
