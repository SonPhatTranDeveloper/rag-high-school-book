**Ms Smith:** Good morning. Welcome to our exhibition: Future Cities. Here you can see models of our cities of the future. Please take a look around and feel free to ask me any questions.

**Nam:** This model looks very interesting. Can you tell me more about it, Ms Smith?

**Ms Smith:** Yes. This is a "green city" designed to reduce its negative impact on the environment. As you can see, more than fifty per cent of it is made up of green areas.

**Nam:** I don't see any private vehicles on the roads.

**Ms Smith:** Most people will use public transport such as trams and electric buses. There will be fewer traffic jams and less pollution.

**Nam:** So city dwellers will stop using their cars in urban areas.

**Ms Smith:** That's the idea.

**Nam:** I like it. It seems a good solution to many environmental problems.

**Mai:** Let's look at the city over there. I can see robots and lots of cameras in the streets. What's special about this city?

**Ms Smith:** It's called a "smart city". AI technologies, such as cameras and smart sensors, will be installed to help the city operate more efficiently.

**Mai:** The modern infrastructure of the city looks beautiful. I'm really impressed with the high-rise buildings.
