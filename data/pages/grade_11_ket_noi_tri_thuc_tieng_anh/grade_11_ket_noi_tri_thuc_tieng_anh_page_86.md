## PROJECT

### Choosing the perfect educational institution

Work in groups. Do some research on educational institutions for school-leavers (e.g. colleges, universities, vocational schools) in Viet Nam. Choose one that you think has the best programme for a particular subject, trade, or job, and present your findings to the class.

Use these questions as cues for your presentation.
1. What type of educational institution is it? Where is it? How big is it?
2. What programme or training for that particular subject, trade, or job does it offer? How much is the fee?
3. What facilities does it have? Are there any student activities or clubs?
4. What job opportunities are there for its students after graduation?
