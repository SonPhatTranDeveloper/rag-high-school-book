## I GETTING STARTED

Earning your parents' trust

1 Listen and read.

Nam: Mai, why don't you answer your phone? It keeps ringing.
Mai: It's my mum who's calling me again. She wants me to contact her from time to time while I'm out.
Nam: My parents used to be like that. They thought I didn't have the confidence to deal with difficult situations.
Mark: I had the same experience. It was earning my parents' trust that took a long time. But I managed to convince them that I'm responsible when I'm out and about.
Mai: It's my parents who still think I don't have the skills to be independent. I'm not good at managing my time or money, but I'm independent at home - I can cook, clean the house, and do my laundry!
Nam: That's a good start! I use a time-management app to plan my weekly schedule including all my activities and responsibilities. Would you like me to help you install it?
Mai: That'd be great. Thanks, Nam.
Mark: I use a money-management app. It's the app that taught me how to be responsible with money.
Mai: Mark, can you show it to me?
Mark: No problem. My parents also encourage me to take part-time jobs and pay me for doing certain chores around the house.
Mai: Lucky you!
