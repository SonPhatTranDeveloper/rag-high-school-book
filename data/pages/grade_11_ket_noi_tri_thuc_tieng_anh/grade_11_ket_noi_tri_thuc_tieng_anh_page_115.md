3 Work in groups. Your class is on a field trip to a national park. Read the situations below and think of some possible responses. Provide reasons for each answer.

1. Some of your classmates want to collect some rare insects/flowers for their collection.

Example: 'You shouldn't do that for several reasons. First, rare plant and animal species are endangered. Second, if people start killing or collecting them, they will soon disappear. Finally, this will harm local biodiversity and have a serious effect on the balance of the local ecosystem.'

2. Some classmates have brought some snacks and want to feed the wild animals in the park.

3. You see some classmates throwing rubbish, such as plastic bottles, paper, and cans, on the grass and in the water.
