THE EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY FOR SCHOOL-LEAVERS

This month, Teen Talk magazine has received many letters from secondary school students asking about the different options for school-leavers. We've talked to educational experts, and they think that young people should either continue their studies at a college or university or go to a vocational school.

A.
Higher education is really for people who want formal learning in order to get an academic degree. If you are good at certain subjects and need a degree related to those subjects, then university is the right choice for you. Besides studying, university students also have the opportunity to live independently, make new friends, and join different clubs. Many students still manage to work part-time during their university years. In addition, college or university students usually have an advantage over students from vocational schools when it comes to further studies after a degree. They will also have broader career options and an advantage in the job market.

B.
If you are not interested in traditional academic subjects and want to work in a specific trade, then vocational education is the right choice for you. You will gain the practical skills and knowledge necessary for a specific job. In addition, a vocational school may also offer you an apprenticeship. This type of training not only provides students with hands-on experience, but also gives them wages to cover their living costs. Most importantly, vocational training is usually much shorter than a college or university course. After getting their vocational qualifications, graduates can immediately start work and earn a salary.

There are a lot of educational opportunities for school-leavers today. You can choose from hundreds of vocational schools or higher education institutions to continue your educational journey.
