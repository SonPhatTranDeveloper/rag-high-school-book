Pronunciation
Intonation in question tags

2 Read the conversation again and decide whether these statements are true (T) or false (F).

| | T | F |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Nam went to Cuc Phuong National Park two weeks ago. | | |
| 2. In an ecosystem, plants, animals, and other living and non-living things form a community. | | |
| 3. We are losing a large number of ecosystems around the world. | | |

Remember!

- We use falling intonation on the question tag when we are almost sure of the answer and we think that the listener will confirm that our statement is correct, or we want to gently persuade the listener.
Example: A: The tiger is an endangered animal, isn't it?
         B: Yes, it is./That's right.

- We can also use falling intonation on the tag to make a point.
Example: It's a beautiful view, isn't it?

- We use rising intonation on the question tag when we are not so sure of the answer.
Example: A: You didn't do your homework, did you?
         B: Yes, I did.
