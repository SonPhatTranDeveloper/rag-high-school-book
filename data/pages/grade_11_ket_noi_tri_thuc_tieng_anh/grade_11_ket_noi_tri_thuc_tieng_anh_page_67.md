Unit 6: Preserving our heritage

GETTING STARTED

Heritage sites in Viet Nam

1 Listen and read.

Ms Hoa: Good morning, everyone. As part of our school cultural programme, we need to plan a field trip to a heritage site in Viet Nam. So, where would you like to go?

Peter: Do you have any suggestions for us, Ms Hoa?

Ms Hoa: I'd recommend Trang An Scenic Landscape Complex. It's the only place in Southeast Asia to be recognised as a mixed heritage site by UNESCO.

Peter: What's a mixed heritage site?

Ms Hoa: It's a site that has both natural and cultural importance. For example, you can go on a boat trip there to enjoy the beautiful landscape. Or you can visit the old temples and monuments to learn about Vietnamese history.

Anna: That sounds interesting, but if we want to learn about cultural values of the past, where should we go?

Ms Hoa: You can go to Hoi An Ancient Town in central Viet Nam. You'll learn about urban lifestyles and traditions from the 15th to the 19th century and will see examples of ancient architecture. All buildings are kept in their original state. It's a great place to explore.

Anna: Wow! That's exciting. What about southern Viet Nam?
