PRESERVING OUR HERITAGE: IDEAS FROM TEENAGERS

To encourage young people to learn about and appreciate our cultural heritage, we organised an ideas competition. We invited students from across the country to send us their ideas for protecting and promoting our heritage. We have received many interesting entries. Below are the winners.

A.
The idea of promoting heritage sites through social media came from a group of 11th grade students. They suggested using social media activities, such as photo competitions, to encourage young people to learn about our heritage sites and local traditions on important festivals. They also suggested creating trending topics or challenges on social media. For example, a postcard challenge will invite people to create and share unusual and exciting postcards about the heritage sites that they have visited.

B.
Two 10th grade students suggested forming historical societies or local groups who have a keen interest in their history and heritage. These groups will provide information about local heritage sites, organise special events to celebrate local festivals, and invite young people to discuss issues related to preserving the heritage. This way, they will be able to give voice to suggestions and solutions to problems they care about. They will feel that their voices are heard, and they can contribute to society.

C.
To preserve heritage, such as traditional music and stories, a group of secondary school students proposed setting up folk clubs. The clubs will hold events for young people to experience and learn about traditional performing arts. The artists will not only perform, but also introduce their arts and talk about how students can help promote folk culture. The clubs will organise training for students who want to learn folk songs, a traditional musical instrument, or folk dancing.
