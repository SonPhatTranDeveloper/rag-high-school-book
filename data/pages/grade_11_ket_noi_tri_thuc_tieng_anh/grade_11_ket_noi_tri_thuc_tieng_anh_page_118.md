PROTECTING ECOSYSTEMS - IDEAS FROM AROUND THE WORLD

The healthier our ecosystems are, the healthier our planet and its people become. Ecosystem restoration can help end poverty, fight climate change, and prevent loss of flora and fauna on every continent and in every ocean. Below are two examples of successful ecological projects.

The Great Green Wall

The goal of this project is to create the largest living structure on the planet. The plan is to restore 100 million hectares of damaged land, limit the amount of carbon dioxide and create 10 million green jobs in Africa. This will provide rich land, food security, and improve the region's ability to deal with climate change. Since its launch in 2007, Ethiopia and Nigeria have restored millions of hectares of land, and Senegal has planted more than 10 million trees.

Belize Barrier Reef

The Belize Barrier Reef was once described as the most amazing reef in the West Indies. It is home to a large diversity of plants and animals. It is Belize's top tourist destination, popular for scuba diving and snorkelling, and a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site. Between 2009 and 2018, it was declared endangered because of pollution and the destruction of its ecosystems. However, because of conservation efforts, a large part of the reef is now protected. There are seven marine reserves. Belize has also stopped oil drilling near the Barrier Reef, banned plastic products, and created 'no-take zones', where removing plants and animals is not allowed.
