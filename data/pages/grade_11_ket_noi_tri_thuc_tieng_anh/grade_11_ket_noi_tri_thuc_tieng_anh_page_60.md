Tips

One of the purposes of writing a leaflet is to persuade the readers to agree with you. You should:
• use a heading to grab readers' attention.
• begin each paragraph with a catchy subheading.
• develop each idea in a separate paragraph.
• keep the language of the leaflet simple, brief, and clear.
• use easy-to-remember slogans to express your ideas quickly and attract the readers' attention.
• end your leaflet with a good call for action.
• include images and different colours to make your leaflet look attractive and interesting.
