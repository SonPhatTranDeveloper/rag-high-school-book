Grammar
Perfect gerunds

Remember!

The perfect gerund (having done) always refers to a time before that of the verb in the main clause. It is used to emphasise that the action was completed in the past. It can be used as:

• the subject of a sentence.
Example: Having studied science subjects made it easy for me to choose a university degree.

• an object after some verbs. e.g. admit, deny, forget, mention, regret, and remember or after prepositions.
Example: My friend didn't remember having lent me his English textbook.
My cousin often talked about having studied for five years at a top university.

3. Nam regretted not having choose a more interesting course at university.

Perfect participle clauses

Remember!

The perfect participle has the same form as the perfect gerund, e.g. having asked, having studied.
We can use perfect participle clauses to:

• describe an action that happened before the action in the main clause.
Example: Having finished their course, they started looking for jobs.

• talk about the reason for the action in the main clause.
Example: Not having read the book, he can't give us his opinion.
