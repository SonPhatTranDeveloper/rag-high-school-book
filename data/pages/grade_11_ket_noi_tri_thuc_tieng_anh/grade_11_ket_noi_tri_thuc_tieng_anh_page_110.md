Unit 9

# PROJECT

## A social awareness campaign

Work in groups. Your class is starting a campaign to raise people's awareness about different social issues in your community. Each group is responsible for planning activities for one social issue.

Give a group presentation. Use these questions as cues.

- What is the social issue? How does it affect the community?
- Who will participate in your campaign? Who can help to fix this issue?
- What activities do you plan to include in your campaign? What are the goals?
