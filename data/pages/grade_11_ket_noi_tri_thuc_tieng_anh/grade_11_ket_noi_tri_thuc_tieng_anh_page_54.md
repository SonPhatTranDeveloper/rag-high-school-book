Sentence stress and rhythm

Remember!
• Content words (e.g. main verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs) are often stressed, while grammatical words (e.g. conjunctions, pronouns, prepositions, auxiliaries, articles) are not.

• This combination of stressed and unstressed syllables produces the rhythm of spoken English.

• To sound natural and fluent, you should try to stress the correct words in your spoken sentences.
