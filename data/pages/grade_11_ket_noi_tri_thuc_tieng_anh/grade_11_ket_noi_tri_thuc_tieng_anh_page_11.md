Grammar

Past simple vs. Present perfect

Remember!

We use the past simple to describe:
• something that started and finished in the past.
Example: You did a great job yesterday.
• something that was completed in the past (often used with a time phrase).
Example: We lived in Ha Noi when I was little. Now we live in Hai Phong.

We use the present perfect to describe:
• something that started in the past, and is still happening now (often used with since, for, so far).
Example: You have done a great job so far.
• something that was completed in the very recent past (often used with just or recently).
Example: We have just moved to Hai Phong.
