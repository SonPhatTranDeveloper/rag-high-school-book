CUC PHUONG NATIONAL PARK

A.
As the oldest national park in Viet Nam, Cuc Phuong is a natural habitat of many rare animals and plants in Asia. It is estimated that over 2,000 plant species and thousands of species of animals live in the 22,000-hectare ecosystem. The park also has the largest variety of birds in northern Viet Nam with more than 3,000 bird species.

B.
The rich ecosystem of Cuc Phuong attracts many nature lovers from all over the world. The park is very popular from April to May, when visitors have a chance to see more than 400 species of colourful butterflies in the forest. That's why it has won the award of Asia's Leading National Park several times.

C.
Despite the government's effort to protect Cuc Phuong, several problems have been reported. Small parts of the park have been destroyed as people have cut down old trees without permission. In addition, rare animals were hunted illegally, some of which were fortunately rescued and returned to the forest. There are still irresponsible tourists who drop litter on the trails, which pollutes the water and soil. These actions can damage the ecosystem of the park. Therefore, tougher measures should be taken to protect the biodiversity of the area.
