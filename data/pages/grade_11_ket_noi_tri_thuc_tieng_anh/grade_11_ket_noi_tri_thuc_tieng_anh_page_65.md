ASEAN Youth Forum (AYF) is a programme for young people in ASEAN, which allows them to express their opinions and fight for their right to live in a sustainable and caring regional community. Its members regularly hold meetings and workshops to discuss the problems facing young people in ASEAN and how to address them. AYF also organises Youth: Open Space - an online space for young Southeast Asians to meet, connect, share and talk about current issues such as climate change, health, education, technology and online security.

Over the past decade, AYF has had meetings in all ASEAN countries. It has connected thousands of young leaders from Southeast Asia, who meet to discuss and suggest strategies for making ASEAN a better community. These conferences aim to improve young people's leadership skills and strengthen regional unity.
