1 Read the text and match each percentage in the chart with ONE social problem mentioned in the text.

SOCIAL PROBLEMS FACING TEENS IN THE US TODAY

Top problems teens see among their peers (%)
1. ________ 70
2. ________ 55
3. ________ 40
4. ________ 15

In many countries around the world, it is not easy growing up because teens are dealing with many social issues. A study carried out by a famous research centre in the US found out that the following were among the most serious ones.

Anxiety and depression: Seven in ten teenagers considered them a serious problem among their peers. The main source of teenagers' anxiety and depression was social pressure, such as the pressure to look good, to fit in social groups, and to be good at sport.

Bullying: 55% said that bullying was a major problem for teenagers, and around 15% admitted that they had experienced some form of cyberbullying. Girls or younger students were more likely to be victims of bullying.

Poverty: Four out of 10 teens said that poverty was also a major problem for them. In fact, about 20% of the teens in the survey struggled to live below the poverty line every day.

The survey results suggest that more support should be provided to help teenagers avoid serious social issues and enjoy a happier life.
