Review 1

Reading

1 Read the text. Match the headings (1-3) with the paragraphs (A-C).

1. Comparing to others    2. Lack of understanding    3. Lack of interaction

In most cultures, there is a generation gap between parents and their children. There are many reasons for this gap. Below are three of them.

A.
As each generation is strongly influenced by changes in society, parents and children may see the world differently. In addition, different lifestyles make it difficult for parents and their children to fully understand each other's way of thinking. Many adult children even cut all ties with their parents.

B.
Busy work and school schedules often prevent parents and children from spending time together. After a long and stressful day at work, parents come home, often feeling exhausted, and have little time to spend with their children. This leads to a lack of communication and widens the generation gap.

C.
Many parents keep comparing their children to other children, or even to how they behaved as children. They think it is good for their children to see these good examples and try to improve. However, this only makes the gap wider and causes their children to lose confidence in themselves. Some children may even start hating those people that they are compared to.
