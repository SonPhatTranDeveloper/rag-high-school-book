3. carbon: a situation in which different things are equal
4. methane: gases or other substances that are sent into the atmosphere

4 Read the article again and choose the correct answers A, B, or C.

1. Which of the following is not a COP's key goal?
A. Stop cutting down forests.
B. Replace coal with cleaner sources of energy.
C. End methane emissions.

2. What will happen if there is a balance between the greenhouse gases released and those removed from the atmosphere?
A. Global warming will be limited to 1.5Â°C.
B. Global CO2 emissions will increase.
C. Countries will switch to clean energy.

3. Why is it important to reduce the use of coal?
A. Because it is easy to build coal plants.
B. Because coal is not as clean as gas.
C. Because it is responsible for a large part of the CO2 emissions.

4. How does deforestation contribute to global warming?
A. Trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
B. Trees release carbon into the atmosphere when they are cut down or burnt.
C. Forests trap heat and increase temperatures.

5. Why is reducing methane emissions a key goal?
A. Because its emissions result from farming activities and landfill waste.
B. Because methane's warming power is stronger than that of CO2.
C. Because it is produced through human activities.

5 Work in groups. Discuss the following question.

What should we do to reduce global warming?

IV SPEAKING

Human activities and global warming

1 Match the activities (1-3) with their possible effects on the environment (a-f).

1. Cutting down or burning forests
2. Burning coal, oil, and gas
3. Raising farm animals like goats, sheep, and cows

a. When burnt, fossil fuels release greenhouse gases, trapping heat in the atmosphere.
b. When eating, these animals produce a lot of methane. This gas is responsible for nearly one-third of current global warming.
c. Trees use CO2 to grow, so when they are cut down or burnt, the CO2 in the air increases.
d. Carbon from fossil fuels combines with oxygen in the air to form large amounts of CO2.
e. Forests store carbon in the trees and soil, and help reduce the global temperature.
f. Forests are cut down to make space for farm animals.
