Hashtag activism - worth clicking on?

Platforms like Facebook and Twitter are being used more and more to raise awareness of social issues and to campaign for good causes. There have been several examples of successful campaigns in recent years. For instance, the #IceBucketChallenge proved a viral success in raising awareness and funds for ALS, a disease that progressively paralyses the body. Not only did people all over the world post videos of themselves tipping a bucket of iced water over their heads, but they also nominated other people to do the challenge, as well as donating to the Association.

It is not always clear how effective many of these social media campaigns actually are. Critics claim that 'hashtagging' a cause is more about copying the crowd than showing true commitment. They say that clicking on a hashtag trend is easy and doesn't initiate a real desire for change. Though there may be some truth in this, raising awareness is surely the first step to a successful campaign.
