## Reading

Read the text. Match paragraphs (A–C) with questions (1–6). Each paragraph matches two questions.

In which paragraph does the author mention ...
1 an extra received on top of the wages?
2 something that might give away the identity of the worker?
3 a trend which has changed employment prospects?
4 typical consumer behaviour?
5 the difficulty of finding a job in the field?
6 a good reason for doing the job?

### A secret job in the retail trade

**A** I am in a supermarket, doing my best to look like any other shopper browsing the shelves. My mission on this trip is to buy something I fancy from the bakery, which means I'll have to interact with the person at the counter. I'm hoping to pass off the handwritten notes I'm carrying as a shopping list, because no one must know why I am here. I have to keep my identity secret because I am a mystery shopper.

**B** My job involves visiting five to ten different stores a day and scoring them on, among other things, their appearance and cleanliness. With the €20 I am given to spend at each store, I purchase the obligatory item that enables me to assess the service I receive at the checkout. Adding the value of my purchase to the €225 I make in a typical day of eight hours of visits and two hours filing reports, I earn more than enough to live on.

**C** However, assignments paying as well as mine are becoming few and far between due to the soaring demand in my line of work. Retailers increasingly need to maintain standards so as to offer consumers a quality shopping experience and keep them from turning to the internet. However, to date, there are more than half a million mystery shoppers registered in the UK, making competition for jobs very fierce. Today it isn't only other shoppers I hide my identity from; even my friends and family don't know who I work for.
