4.2 Future time clauses
• We use present tenses instead of will or be going to in future time clauses after time conjunctions such as after, as soon as, by the time, immediately, in case, once, the minute, the moment, until and when.
I'll phone you as soon as we reach the hotel.
I'll take an umbrella in case it rains.
He'll let me know the minute he hears any news.

• We usually use the present perfect (not the future perfect) for actions that are complete in the future after future time clauses.
We'll ring you as soon as we've got to the festival.

• We use the present continuous (not the future continuous) for actions in progress in the future after future time clauses.
I'll ring you back when I'm sitting on the train.

4.3 Adverbs and adverbial phrases
• Some adverbs have the same form as the adjective: early, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.
We do a weekly shop in town.
Is this magazine published weekly?

• Other adjectives ending in -ly do not have an adverbial form: friendly, lively, cowardly, motherly, lovely, etc. Instead we put the adjective in an adverbial phrase:
He smiled in a friendly way and waved at us.

• Some adverbs have two forms: one with -ly and one without: close / closely, deep / deeply, late / lately, pretty / prettily, etc. The meanings are sometimes very similar and sometimes unrelated.
Does your uncle live close to you?
English and German are closely related languages.
We're going to be late.
I haven't seen my best friend lately.
