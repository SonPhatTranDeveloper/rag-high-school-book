Tell us what you think is important in a best friend.

JACKO: Well, I hope to be supported by a best friend when I have a problem and I expect them to spend time listening to me. I also don't want to have to apologise for being me!

QUEEN: I agree. A good friend shouldn't mind putting up with the bad side of my personality. They should also be honest and warn me against doing things they don't think are good. And they should advise me to do things they think are good, even if I decide not to do them!

MATE365: Good points. A best friend doesn't choose to be your friend only when things are going well. They should always be there when you need them!
