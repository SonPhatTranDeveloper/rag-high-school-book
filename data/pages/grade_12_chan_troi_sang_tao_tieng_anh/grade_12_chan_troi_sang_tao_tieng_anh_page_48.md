1 Cai Luong, a form of traditional Vietnamese theatre, emerged around the 1910s and gained popularity among the communities in the south, especially in the Mekong Delta region. In the early years, Cai Luong performances were held in makeshift theatres or open-air spaces, and the plays were often performed by itinerant troupes. Just like a Western circus, they travelled together from place to place, with their families. The children grew up under the influence of parents, aunts and uncles and became actors and actresses when they were kids.

2 Cai Luong uses a combination of music, singing, acting, and dance to depict a wide range of themes and stories. These include historical events, folklore, legends, and contemporary social issues. The performances are characterised by vibrant costumes, bold makeup, and expressive gestures. With its diverse repertoire, Cai Luong offers a reflection on Vietnamese culture, history, values, and societal concerns.

3 The distinctive music in Cai Luong is created by the combination of a variety of instruments. They include the dan tranh, a 16-stringed zither with movable bridges, the dan nguyet, a two-stringed moon-shaped lute, the dan co, a two-stringed fiddle, and a bamboo flute. These instruments produce a melodic and unique sound that complements the storytelling and singing in Cai Luong.

4 Cai Luong owes its development to numerous talented individuals who have contributed their skills and creativity over the years. Prominent figures like Bay Nam, Phung Ha and Ut Tra On, together with others, played crucial roles in shaping and popularising Cai Luong. Through their dedication and artistry, they elevated Cai Luong to become a cherished cultural tradition in Viet Nam. Their contributions continue to inspire generations of performers and ensure the preservation of this rich theatrical heritage.

5 At present, Cai Luong faces concerns about its future due to the declining interest among younger generations and the influence of modern entertainment. However, efforts to raise awareness, engage new audiences, and adapt to new tastes may safeguard the sustainability of Cai Luong in the years to come.
