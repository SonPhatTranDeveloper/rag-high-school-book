Physician Akrit Jaswal had a very unusual childhood. He didn't use to play with toys like most children. Instead, he used to read a lot - he could read and write from the age of two. And what did he use to read as a five-year-old boy? Shakespeare! He also had a passion for science and would read everything he could find about human anatomy. He performed his first operation at the age of seven, treating the badly burned hands of a young girl whose family couldn't afford medical care. This operation was filmed and posted on YouTube - leading to worldwide fame for Akrit. At the age of twelve, he was accepted into a medical university. He studied there for several years. He was the youngest ever to achieve this in India at that time ...
