Unit 1

1.1 Negative adverbials
We can make a sentence more emphatic by putting a negative adverb (or adverbial phrase) at the front. These include: never, nowhere, not since, not only ... also, no sooner ... than, hardly, rarely / seldom, under no circumstances, (in) no way, at no time, only (if / when / once), not until. After the adverb or phrase, the word order is inverted. They are usually followed by an auxiliary verb.

1 Complete the second sentence in each pair so that it means the same as the first.

1 I've never eaten such a delicious meal before!
   Never __________ such a delicious meal!
2 We weren't asked for our opinion at any time.
   At __________ asked for our opinion.
3 She won't speak to you until you apologise.
   Not until __________ speak to you.
4 You won't see more beautiful scenery anywhere.
   Nowhere __________ beautiful scenery.

   Under __________ tickets be refunded.

1.2 Negative questions, infinitives and -ing forms
• We can use negative questions to ask for confirmation of something that we think is true or is not true.
• We can use negative questions to express our opinions more politely.
