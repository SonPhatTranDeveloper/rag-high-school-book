Introduction
The aim of this report is to assess the plan to ban traffic from the town centre. I have interviewed a number of local people and visitors, and my conclusion and recommendation take their views into account.

Advantages
Most visitors were of the opinion that the town centre would be a quieter and more pleasant place to spend time if there were no traffic. An added benefit mentioned was a reduction in air pollution. Finally, it was thought that the roads would be safer for cyclists.

Disadvantages
According to some local shopkeepers, banning cars from the centre would damage trade as shoppers would have to park some distance away and carry heavy shopping to their cars. What is more, visitors would also have to park outside the town and this might discourage them from paying a visit.

Conclusion
Although opinion seems to be divided on the desirability of the scheme, people expressing opposition to the proposal were in a minority. I would suggest that the council press ahead with its plan as it will improve the quality of life of both residents and visitors.
