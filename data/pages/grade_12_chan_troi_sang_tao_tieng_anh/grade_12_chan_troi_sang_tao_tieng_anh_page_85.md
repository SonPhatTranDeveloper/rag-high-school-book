The fitness trends

A Reformer Pilates is a much more intense form of Pilates. It involves doing the same sort of pushing and stretching exercises, but on equipment resembling a rowing machine. It isn't the kind of thing you'd have at home, so you have to go to a special Pilates centre to try it. If you do, bear in mind that you won't be able to walk up or down stairs for a few days afterwards. At first, it looks quite easy, but towards the end of the session, your thighs will be crying out for mercy.

B Jumping up and down on a trampoline is a lot of fun, but it can make a great workout too. You'd be surprised by how exhausted you are after only a few minutes bouncing. Not only is it better for the heart than running, but it also increases co-ordination and helps reduce stress levels. Trampolining is taking off in a big way, and some new centres have as many as 150 trampolines. You can either have a go at 'freejumping' - without an instructor - or pay someone to teach you how to do it properly.

C If you're usually quite active, but you're feeling down in the dumps, then you might like to try Dynamic Running Therapy - going out for a run with a therapist. The sessions are quite pricey as the therapists are professionals and they charge a bit more than the going rate. It's easier to do both activities when you're running and talking at the same time: you run further because you don't notice your sore feet, and you talk more freely than you would in the therapist's office.
