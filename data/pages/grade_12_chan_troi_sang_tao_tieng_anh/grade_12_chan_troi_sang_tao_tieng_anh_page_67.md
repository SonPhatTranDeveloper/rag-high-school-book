Position and order of adjectives
I can use adjectives correctly.

1 Read the message board. Who thinks highly of the HR manager?

[Image description: A message board with three posts about an HR manager named Lam Anh. The first post praises her as talented and charitable. The second agrees she's great and comments on her appearance. The third post criticizes self-centered people in management positions.]

2 Read the Learn this! box. Find all the adjectives in exercise 1. Do they come before a noun or after a linking verb?

LEARN THIS! Position and order of adjectives
1 We can use most adjectives before a noun or after a linking verb (be, become, feel, get, look, seem, smell, sound, taste, etc.).
She's a wonderful singer! Her voice sounds fantastic.

2 When we use more than one adjective to describe a noun, we use this order:
opinion size age colour origin material noun
a fabulous big new red French electric car

3 Look again at the adjectives that come before a noun in exercise 1. Match them with the categories (size, age, colour, etc.) in the Learn this! box.

4 Complete the sentences with the adjectives in brackets in the correct order.
1 My company's forum is talking about a ________ ________ ________ musician. (young / Portuguese / vain)
2 The interviewer was wearing a ________ ________ ________ ________ dress. (Japanese / white / long / silk)
3 At the company's fancy party, the director always appears on stage in a ________ ________ ________ wig. (massive / red / ridiculous)
4 My idol supervisor goes to work on a(n) ________ ________ ________ motorbike. (Italian / black / 1960s)

5 Match the adjectives with similar meanings to make some pairs.
afraid - frightened
afraid alive alone angry annoyed asleep
frightened glad happy live lonely sleeping

LOOK OUT!
There are some adjectives that we do not usually put before a noun. We can use them after a linking verb or use another adjective with a similar meaning.
There were dozens of workers who were upset.
There were dozens of disappointed workers.
NOT There were dozens of upset workers. X

6 Read the Look out! box. Which adjective in each pair from exercise 5 can go a) before a noun and b) only after a linking verb? Use a dictionary to help you.

7 Choose the correct words to complete the sentences. Sometimes both are possible.
1 Ten glad / happy winners have shared this week's lottery prize.
2 The woman was disappointed / upset because the noise woke her asleep / sleeping baby.
3 A ninety-year-old brilliant / French actor has won an award at the Cannes Film Festival.
4 There are some huge grey / nasty clouds in the distance.
5 Some well-known people have quite alone / lonely lives.

8 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Using adjectives and linking verbs, tell your partner about a famous person you would like to meet.
• Give some information about them and what they do.
• Say why you'd like to meet them and how it would make you feel.
