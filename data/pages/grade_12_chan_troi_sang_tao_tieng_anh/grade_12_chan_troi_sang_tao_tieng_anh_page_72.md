A. Becoming a truly great actor requires talent, hard work and hours of study. In Britain, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) trained and produced many of the country's most famous actors since it was established in 1904, but just how does RADA turn passionate young hopefuls into respected professionals?

B. One of the methods RADA teaches is the Stanislavski acting technique. The technique was devised by the famous Russian actor Konstantin Stanislavski in 1911, after he had been performing in theatres for over thirty years. It requires actors to really live the role that they are playing. The actors not only have to learn the lines that they have to say, but also recreate everything about the character's life.

C. But if modern audiences would be surprised to discover that students learn an acting technique that is over a century old, they might be even more astonished to discover that they also study a form of theatre that has been around for over two millennia: Greek tragedy. The Greeks used to study playwriting and acting and produced some important theoretical works on the subject. Their ideas are still considered very relevant today and anybody who wants to obtain a degree from RADA has to study them.

D. RADA students also spend many hours training their voices and learning how to use their bodies to communicate in the same way that a musician learns how to play an instrument. A RADA student's objective is to use their creativity to transform written words into a three-dimensional character. Evidently, becoming an actor is a serious business and definitely not for people who are only interested in fame.
