## Nouns and dependent prepositions

I can use nouns and dependent prepositions.

1 Look at the photos. How do you think these images were made?

2 Read the article. What's the most amusing or unusual hoax image you've seen? Do you think hoaxes are a problem? Why? / Why not?

It's all a hoax

Although technology has created an increase in hoax images, the first fake photo dates back to the 1830s. Some years later, a book claimed to show the surface of the moon – even though this wasn't actually photographed. An obsession with the spirit world led to a series of photos showing ghosts and fairies, and 1940s interest in space travel produced numerous images of alien life. Nowadays, there is plenty of online evidence of our addiction to this visual trickery – there seems to be an endless demand for amusing images of monster cats, mutant squids, and friends posing with Hollywood stars. It can be almost impossible to tell the difference between what's real and what's fake.
