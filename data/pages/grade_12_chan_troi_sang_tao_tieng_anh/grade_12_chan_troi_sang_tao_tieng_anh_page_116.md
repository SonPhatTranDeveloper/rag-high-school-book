We can use the past simple or the past continuous with when, as and while:

Past perfect
We use the past perfect simple for an action that happened before a specific time in the past:
After I had washed up, I watched TV.

1.4 Present perfect simple and present perfect continuous

Present perfect simple
We use the present perfect:
• for recent events, particularly when giving news:
Have you heard? The president has (just) resigned.
• for an action that happened at some unspecified time in the past. (If we specify the time, we use the past simple.)
Have you (ever) seen a koala?
I've been to New York.
• with state verbs, to say how long a situation has existed. (We use for, since or how long.)
I've known Eva for years.
She's lived here since 2001.
• for recent events that have a result in the present.
I've (already) bought the tickets. We can go inside.
I can't go out; I haven't done my homework (yet).

Present perfect continuous
We use the present perfect continuous:
• for actions that have been happening recently and repeatedly.
We've been playing a new computer game recently.
I've been working hard this term.
• to say how long an action has been in progress. (We use for, since or how long.)
Jake has been watching TV for three hours.
• to explain a current situation in terms of recent events.
I'm tired because I've (just) been playing tennis.

Present perfect simple and present perfect continuous
• We use the present perfect simple to emphasise that an action is complete. Compare:
I've been reading 'The Hobbit'. (I'm half way through.)
I've read 'The Hobbit'. (It was great!)
• If we specify an exact number of occasions, we cannot use the continuous form.
We've been arguing a lot.
We've argued twice this week.
(NOT We've been arguing twice this week.)
• We can use the simple or continuous form with just and already. However, we do not use the continuous form with yet.
I've just spoken to Jack. / I've just been speaking to Jack.
I've already worn it. / I've already been wearing it.
Has he packed yet? (NOT Has he been packing yet?)
