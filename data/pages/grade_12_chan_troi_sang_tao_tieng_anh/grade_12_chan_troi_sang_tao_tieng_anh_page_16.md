Negative structures
I can use negative structures.

1 Read the text. Which is the best piece of advice, in your opinion? Do you disagree with any of the advice?

How to talk to teens - a parents' guide

Wouldn't it be great if parents and their teenagers got on all the time? Post your best advice for parents below.

Be calm and reasonable and treat me like an adult. Under no circumstances should you speak to me as if I'm still a small child.

Not only should you avoid speaking down to me, you should also notice when I do things that are good!

Surely, part of being a teenager is being allowed to make mistakes. So it's not a good idea to tell me off every time I get something wrong!

If you're worried about me, just talk to me - calmly! On no account should you get angry. I'm not likely to want to confide in you if you're shouting!

Rarely do teens and their parents agree all the time, but you can still get on well even if you don't always see eye to eye. The best advice to parents? Try not to argue! You may regret not being patient!

2 Read the Learn this! box. Which negative adverbials can you find in exercise 1?

LEARN THIS! Negative adverbials
We can use these negative adverbials to make emphatic negative statements:
never, nowhere, rarely, hardly, in no way, at no time, on no account, only (if / when / once), not until, under no circumstances, not only... also, no sooner... than.
If we use them at the beginning of a sentence, the subject-verb word order changes - they are usually followed by an auxiliary verb.

3 Write the sentences with the correct form of the words in brackets.
1 No sooner (we / eat) dinner than he got up and left.
2 Only once (I / break) a promise in my whole life.
3 At no time (anyone / explain) what had happened.
4 Never before (she / meet) a more disagreeable man.
5 In no way (he / trust) you in the future after all your lies.

4 Rewrite the sentences using inversion.
1 We've never faced such a serious problem.
2 We couldn't find a coffee shop open anywhere.
3 I had hardly woken up when my mobile rang.
4 They weren't aware of the danger at any time.
5 There won't be any more festivals until next year.

LEARN THIS! Negative questions, infinitives and -ing forms
We can use negative questions to ask for confirmation of something we think is true or not true.

We can also use negative questions to express our opinions politely.

We usually form negative infinitives and -ing forms by putting not or never before them.
