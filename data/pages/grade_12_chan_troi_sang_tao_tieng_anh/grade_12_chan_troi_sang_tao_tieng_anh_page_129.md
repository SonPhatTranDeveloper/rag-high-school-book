Unit 7
7.1 Changes in reported speech
Tense changes
• When we report somebody's words rather than quoting them directly, we usually change the tense of any verbs.
'I'm tired,' she said. → She said that she was tired.
The normal pattern of tense changes in reported speech is:

Direct speech → Reported speech
present simple → past simple
present continuous → past continuous
past simple → past perfect simple
present perfect simple → past perfect simple
present perfect continuous → past perfect continuous
past continuous → past perfect continuous
will → would
may / might → might
must → must / had to
can → could

• We do not normally change the tense when
a the reporting verb is present, future or present perfect.
'I prefer playing basketball.'
→ She says she prefers playing basketball.
→ She'll say she prefers playing basketball.
→ She's said she prefers playing basketball.

b we are reporting a past perfect verb, would, could, should or had better.
'We should leave.'
→ She said that we should leave.

• Many modal verbs are usually unchanged after past reporting verbs.
'I might be late.'
→ He said that he might be late.

• We often omit the word that from the beginning of the reported speech clause.
They said it was too expensive.

• There are often changes in words which refer to the people, time or place. These are dictated more by logic than by rules.
'I'll be here tomorrow,' she said.
→ She says she'll be here tomorrow.
(reported on the same day, in the same place)
→ She says she'll be there tomorrow.
(reported on the same day, in a different place)
→ She said she'd be there the next day.
(reported later, in a different place)

• However, these time expressions frequently change in the following way:

Direct speech → Reported speech
today → that day
tonight → that night
tomorrow → the next / following day
next week → the next / following week
ago → before
last week / month → the previous week / month the week / month before

1 Rewrite the sentences, changing the reported speech into direct speech.
