1 Read the text. What do you think made him succeed in getting the job?

[Image description: A young man in a denim shirt is sitting on a couch, smiling while reading a document.]

Last week when John landed the job he had applied for, he got overexcited. That was probably to be expected, given that he had been experiencing ups and downs throughout the months. John is a programmer that graduated two years ago. He set out to apply for jobs right after his graduation. He had been looking at job advertisements even prior to that. His classmates even had established a contact group to offer each other help. They had been working part-time together on small projects. They had been exchanging information for months when he came across this advert of vacancy. He immediately sent the resumé he had been perfecting. Within five months, he had been short-listed for a test, then an interview. What a long journey to this dream job!
