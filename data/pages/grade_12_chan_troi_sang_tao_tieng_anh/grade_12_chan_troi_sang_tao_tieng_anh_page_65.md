1 SPEAKING Describe the photo. What is going on?

2 Read the magazine article. How many types of job interviews are mentioned? Which do you prefer?

WHICH OF THESE HAVE YOU BEEN TO?

PANEL INTERVIEWS
In panel interviews, you are to be interviewed by several interviewers at a time. They usually come from different departments of the company. In certain cases, there may be interviewers from a partner of the company.

GROUP INTERVIEWS
Many candidates are interviewed at the same time. The same question is asked and the candidates give their responses in turn. This way, recruitment process can be shortened and potential employees can be short-listed for more than one position.

ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS
The traditional interview involves one interviewer and one interviewee.

DISTANCE INTERVIEWS
Modern technology has made this possible in the past decade. No longer is distance an obstacle to an interview participant. Nowadays interviews can be conducted via telephone or with video calls.

LUNCH INTERVIEWS
These interviews go on in informal contexts. They sound more like a conversation, but the interviewer actually can also observe how the interviewees interact with others.
