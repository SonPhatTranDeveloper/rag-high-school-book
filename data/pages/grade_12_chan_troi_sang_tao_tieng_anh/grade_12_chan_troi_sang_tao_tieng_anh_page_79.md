1 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Discuss the questions.
1 What was your last dream or nightmare about?
2 Can our dreams help us in our waking lives?

2 Read the text. How could 'lucid dreaming' help students?

The idea that we can control our dreams through a technique called 'lucid dreaming' is usually the stuff of sci-fi films. During lucid dreaming, the sleeper knows they are dreaming and can control what happens – even deciding to have breathtaking experiences like flying. Now, thought-provoking research has received broad-based support from some highly respected scientists, who think it may not be as far-fetched as it sounds.

Lucid dreaming isn't just about mind-blowing experiences. It can be used to improve a variety of skills, from playing the piano to public speaking. It's been shown that people who dream about practising things, like playing the piano, do them better in 'real life' the next day. Well-known athletes also use lucid dreaming to help them deliver record-breaking performances.

You don't need to be highly trained to have lucid dreams, but half-hearted efforts won't work, so try the following steps regularly:

1 Do difficult tasks during the day, such as studying a foreign language; it makes lucid dreaming more likely.
2 Decide what you want to dream about before you sleep.
3 As soon as you wake up and are still bleary-eyed, make notes about dreams while they are fresh in your memory.

Dictionary Strategy
Compound adjectives made up of an adjective + noun + -ed or a noun + -ing form usually have their own dictionary entries. However, compound adjectives made up of an adverb + past participle do not have their own entries, as the meaning is similar to the meaning of the headword.

PRONUNCIATION Diphthongs
A diphthong is a combination of two vowel sounds and its first part is pronounced much longer and more strongly than the second one. There are 8 diphthongs in English.

near /ɪə/   where /eə/   tour /ʊə/   may /eɪ/
like /aɪ/   boy /ɔɪ/   know /əʊ/   our /aʊ/
