## Verb patterns
I am aware of and can use different verb patterns.

1 Read the text. How can a social media campaign help the business?

[Social media icons emanating from a megaphone]

Nowadays, social media can be used for marketing effort known as a social media campaign. In a campaign, businessmen determine what their goal is. Common goals in business may include having users give feedback, getting customers to have more concern for the brand or making sales figures increase. The businessmen would prefer more audience to access their products through suitable media platforms. Of course many free social media marketing apps have been made to track shares, replies, likes and keywords related to a brand. Moreover, certain media services are built to combine with social media accounts to see who is seeing media posts and how they are responding. These tools get users to interact with social media posts, ask questions, provide reviews, and even enter contests. Positive interaction, personal attention and prizes are quite important in a campaign because they get the audience to be more involved in the campaign. And this, in turn, helps businessmen a lot in adjusting their business strategies.
