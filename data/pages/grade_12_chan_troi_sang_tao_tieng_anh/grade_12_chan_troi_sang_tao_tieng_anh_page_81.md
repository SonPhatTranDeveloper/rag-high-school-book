Seventeen-year-old Stacy Irvine's friends visit her and discover that she has been rewarded thousands of free toys from fast food restaurants as a regular customer. Stacy's mother often gave her two-year-old girl a portion of fried chicken in a McDonald's restaurant. Since then, Stacy has refused to eat anything else except for pieces of fried chicken, and as a result, her diet has created serious health. She has been warned that if she doesn't change her diet, she will die. Stacy once collapsed due to lack of vitamins and nutrients and needed to be hospitalised. ________ She insisted that Stacy adopt a healthier lifestyle. However, worryingly, Stacy's mother said that while Stacy was beginning to understand the seriousness of her situation, she couldn't eat anything else but chicken nuggets.

Twenty-year-old Hanna Little was keen on chips. The only thing that Hanna consumed for fifteen years was one plate of chips after another. ________ And it did, because not only did Hanna develop health problems, but she also had to leave her job after collapsing at work. At five, Hanna became addicted to chips and refused to eat fruits and vegetables despite her mother's efforts. Hanna says that she was terrified of tasting the flavour of different types of food and she would feel anxious just at the idea of doing it. ________ Furthermore, Hanna was soon seen as 'odd' by her friends' parents.

It wasn't until the age of sixteen that Hanna realised she had Selective Eating Disorder (SED). Despite this new knowledge, no solution was found. It wasn't until she lost her job before she started eating normally. Hanna sought therapy from psychologist Felix Economakis, who used hypnosis, a treatment that none of the doctors that she had seen before had mentioned, to get her to eat fruit after one one-hour session, and since then she has been willing to eat anything ... including chips!
