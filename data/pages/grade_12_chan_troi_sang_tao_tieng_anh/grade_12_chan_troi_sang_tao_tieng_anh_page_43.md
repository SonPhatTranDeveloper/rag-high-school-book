Hey Sam! Can't wait for you to arrive! I've organised your accommodation - you'll be staying with a neighbor of mine. He's from Mexico, so you'll be able to practice your Spanish while you're on vacation. Public transportation's pretty good here, and I live near the subway, but bring your driver's license anyhow. Maybe we could take a trip out to the theater one evening? Anyway, I'll meet you at the airport on Saturday. New York's beautiful in the fall, so I know we'll have a great time, even if we just play soccer in the yard!
