7.2 Reported questions
• When we report questions, we use affirmative word order and verb forms after the question word.
"How old are you?" he asked me.
→ He asked me how old I was.

• To report a yes / no question (one that has no question word) we use whether or if.
"Is it snowing?" she asked.
→ She asked if it was snowing.
"Do you live in Bristol?" she asked me.
→ She asked me whether I lived in Bristol.

• We do not include question tags in reported questions.
"You're Mia's friend, aren't you?" he asked.
→ He asked me if I was Mia's friend.

• When we report short answers, we use the auxiliary or modal verb from the short answer.
"Do you know the time?" "I don't."
→ He asked me if I knew the time and I said I didn't.

• The object of the verb tell is usually the person who is addressed. We do not use the preposition to.
Have you told your mum?
He told me he was tired.

• We also use tell in set phrases like tell a lie, tell the truth, tell a story, etc.

Other reporting verbs
We can use other verbs instead of say and tell when we report statements, e.g. add, admit, agree, announce, answer, argue, boast, claim, complain, confess, confirm, deny, explain, insist, observe, predict, promise, reply, reveal, swear, warn.
"This bread is stale."
→ He complained that his bread was stale.
"It'll definitely be crowded in town."
→ He predicted that it would be crowded in town.

7.3 Reporting verbs
We can report statements using say or tell or other reporting verbs.

say and tell
• The object of the verb say is always what was said. It is often a clause.
"It's late," said Tom.
She said she was thirsty.

• If we want to mention the person who is addressed, we must use the preposition to.
"I'm going now," she said to her friend.
