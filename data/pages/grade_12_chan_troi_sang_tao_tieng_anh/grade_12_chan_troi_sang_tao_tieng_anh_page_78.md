The passive: advanced structures
I can use advanced passive structures.

1 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Read the statements below. Which do you think are true?
1 If you wake a sleepwalker, they will have a heart attack.
2 You should drink at least eight glasses of water a day.
3 Being slightly fat is good for you.
4 Sleeping longer at weekends makes up for lost sleep.

2 Read the text and check your answers to exercise 1.

MYTH BUSTING
Never wake a sleepwalker
Waking a sleepwalker was once widely believed to be dangerous because it was thought something terrible would happen to them. While nobody likes being woken up, the worst thing they will experience is confusion because they are not in bed!

Drink eight glasses of water a day
This myth is thought to have been started by the bottled water industry. In fact, some of us need as little as a litre of liquid a day, which doesn't have to be consumed as water. Food, soft drinks, milk, tea and coffee all count.

Being a bit overweight is unhealthy
It is often reported that serious health problems can be caused by obesity. However, people carrying an extra couple of kilos in weight might actually live longer.

You can catch up on lost sleep
During the week, your sleep might be disturbed by late-night study, noisy neighbours, or a night out. But forget about sleeping longer at the weekend – staying in bed too long is thought to make you feel more tired!

3 Read the Learn this! box. Then find examples of each rule in the text in exercise 2.

LEARN THIS! The passive: advanced structures
1 We can use passive structures with present and past forms of modal verbs.
   Everyone should be encouraged to eat healthily.
   My computer must have been hacked.
2 Verbs that are followed by an infinitive or gerund can also be followed by a passive infinitive or gerund.
   She hopes to be accepted into medical school.
   I hate being told what to eat.
3 We can introduce ideas and opinions by using think, believe, say, know, report, etc. and passive structures.
   a it + passive + that:
     It is estimated that we need eight hours' sleep each night.
     In the past, it was thought that bathing was bad for you.
   b subject + passive + present or perfect infinitive:
     Cigarettes are known to cause lung cancer.
     Heart disease is known to have caused over 90,000 deaths in the UK last year.

4 Write the sentences with the words in brackets and the correct passive form. Then match each sentence with a rule from the Learn this! box.
