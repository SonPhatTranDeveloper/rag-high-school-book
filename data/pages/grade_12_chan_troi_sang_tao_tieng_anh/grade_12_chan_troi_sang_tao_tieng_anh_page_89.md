Listening Strategy
Speakers often use intonation to express their opinion or attitude about the statements they make. Pay attention to the speaker's tone of voice and the intonation they use to find out how they feel about their subject.

3 3:03 Read the Listening Strategy. Listen again to the first part of the story. Pay attention to the extracts (1-4) and match each extract with one of the adjectives below. There are two extra adjectives.

angry enthusiastic nervous patient sarcastic surprised

1 Max A horror story. Great, Ian. They're so interesting.
2 Jill Oh shush, Max. Fantastic! How scary is it?
3 Ian Well, whatever. I'm not saying it isn't true. It could easily be true.
4 Caro Oh, dear. I don't like this story already.

PRONUNCIATION Intonation and meaning

1 Qualifying an opinion
Rising intonation can give the spoken words a slightly modified opinion:

The film's quite good ... (there's an implied but at the end)

2 Flat voice for sarcasm or irony
If we use a flat tone, we mean the opposite to the words we use:
Brilliant! → (You mean it.)
Brilliant. → (You don't mean it.)

4 3:04 Read the Pronunciation box. Then listen carefully to the examples. Repeat them, copying the intonation.

5 3:05 Listen to the examples from the story. Match them with the rules in the Pronunciation box.
