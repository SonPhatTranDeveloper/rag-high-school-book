Mina: But I thought you two got on really well!
Bill: So did I. But she started putting me down in front of her friends, and when she let me down again last night ... Well, I couldn't put up with it any more. I decided she'd put me through enough, so I split up with her.

LEARN THIS! Phrasal verbs
1 Phrasal verbs can be transitive (they have an object) or intransitive (they don't have an object).
Can you pick me up after school?
My brother and his girlfriend broke up yesterday.

2 When a transitive phrasal verb is inseparable, the object comes after the particle.
He's trying to get over their break up.

3 When a transitive phrasal verb is separable, the object can usually go before or after the particle.
He's decided to call their date off / call off their date.
However, when the object is a pronoun, it must come before the particle.
Do you think Ella will turn him down?

4 With some transitive phrasal verbs, the object must come before the particle.
Donna messed Bill about, so he finished with her.
NOT Donna messed about Bill, so he finished with her. X

5 Three-part phrasal verbs are always transitive and are usually inseparable, so the object comes after the particles.
I've decided to split up with my boyfriend.
