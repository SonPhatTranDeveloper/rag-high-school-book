### Medical breakthroughs

A After twenty years of research, scientists have finally succeeded in developing a vaccine for dengue, a viral disease found in tropical areas. The illness causes high fever and severe joint pain, and in some cases, it can be fatal. According to the World Health Organisation, each year between 50 and 100 million people develop dengue, which is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The commercialised vaccine can protect children in Asia and Latin America against the virus.

B Artificial limbs have been around since ancient times, but no prosthetic has been as lifelike as the Bebionic small hand. The appliance not only looks like a hand, but it also works like one. Electrical impulses triggered by the user's muscle movements connect to individual motors and powerful microprocessors in each finger, causing it to move. Specifically aimed at women and teenagers, the artificial hand enables the user to perform a range of activities previously unmanageable, such as using cutlery and riding a bike.

C Good news for migraine patients – a special device is available. The battery-driven headband sits across the forehead and over the ears and has a self-adhesive electrode, which helps it stay in place. This electrode applies an electric current to the skin and tissue below the headband stimulating the nerves which are said to trigger the headaches. By wearing the headband for the recommended twenty minutes per day, users are said to experience significantly fewer migraines.
