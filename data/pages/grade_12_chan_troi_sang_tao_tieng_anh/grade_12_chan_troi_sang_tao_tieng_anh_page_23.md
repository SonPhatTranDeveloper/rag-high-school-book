## An opinion essay

I can write an opinion essay on the topic of friendship.

1 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Discuss the questions below.
1 Who are the people you are closest to?
2 What qualities do you look for in a friend?

2 Read the task and the essay. In which paragraphs does the writer cover each element of the task?

It is sometimes claimed that 'opposites attract' when it comes to friendship. Write an essay in which you give your own opinion of this view taking into consideration personality and appearance.

### LEARN THIS! Structures and features to use in essays

1 Join clauses with linkers to make longer, more complex sentences.
   I like him. But he can be a bit mean. → I like him, although he can be a bit mean.
2 Passive structures. These can create a sense of objectivity and authority.
   People often say that ... → It is often said that ...
3 Preparatory it. We can use it in a cleft sentence to emphasise a particular part of a sentence.
   Honesty is important. → It is honesty that is important.

### Writing Strategy

Use a variety of grammatical structures and vocabulary instead of simple sentences. This will make your essay more interesting and more effective.

4 Rewrite the sentences using a structure from the Learn this! box. Start with the words in brackets.
1 Online conversations are quick and easy. They are often superficial. (Although ...)
2 The non-verbal aspects of conversations are really important. (It is ...)
3 A lot of people believe that you only need a few close friends. (It is ...)
4 People are busy. They can still keep in touch using social media. (Even if ...)

5 Read the task. Then make notes under headings (A–C) below. Include ideas from exercise 4 and your own opinions.

It is sometimes said that social media friends are not real friends. Give your own opinion of this view, commenting on the best and worst aspects of online friendships and how face-to-face interactions are different.

A Online friendships: benefits
B Online friendships: possible problems
C Face-to-face relationships: unique features

6 Write your essay (180–200 words) using your notes in exercise 5.
