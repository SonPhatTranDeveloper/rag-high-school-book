My best friend's started hanging out with people who are two or three years older than we are. I didn't mind at first, but now he's going to a concert with them after he'd said he'd go with me. He can't have forgotten – in fact, I'm sure he's done it on purpose. He hasn't got anything in common with them and he's recently been going to places where he's under age. Of course I don't want him to get in trouble, but I just don't know what to do. MARCO
