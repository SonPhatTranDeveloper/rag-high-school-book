Unit 2

2.1 Comparative structures
• Comparative and superlative adjectives are formed with -er and -est or more / most and less / least, unless they are irregular:

(regular)
difficult | more difficult | most difficult
hot | hotter | hottest
(irregular)
good | better | best
far | further | furthest

• Comparative and superlative adverbs are usually formed with more and most, unless they are irregular:

(regular)
slowly | more slowly | most slowly
(irregular)
badly | worse | worst
well | better | best

• A few comparative and superlative adverbs are formed with -er and -est, like adjectives: early, fast, hard, late, near, soon.

• Some determiners also have comparative and superlative forms:
few fewer fewest
little less least
much / many more most

2.2 Qualifying comparatives
• We can use (so) much or far to make the meaning of a comparative form more extreme.

• We use even to express surprise.

• We can use a little, slightly, a bit, a lot, or no to modify a comparison.

• We can modify a comparison with as ... as by using just, almost, nearly, nowhere near, or nothing like.

• We can talk about a gradual change by repeating a comparative form.

• We can use this comparative structure to show that two things change because they are connected.

• Comparisons often have a clause after than.

2.3 Infinitive and -ing forms
• When we put two verbs together, the second verb is usually in the infinitive or -ing form. Sometimes it is an infinitive with to or a past participle. Which pattern we use depends on the first verb.

verb + infinitive with to
agree, arrange, ask, beg, dare, decide, expect, fail, happen, hope, manage, mean, offer, prepare, pretend, promise, refuse, seem, want, wish, would like, would prefer and help (can also be infinitive without to)

verb + -ing form
admit, advise, avoid, can't bear, can't help, can't stand, carry on, consider, delay, dislike, enjoy, envisage, fancy, feel like, finish, give up, have difficulty, like, imagine, intend, it's no good, it's not worth, justify, keep (on), mind, miss, postpone, practise, propose, put off, recollect, recommend, risk, spend (time), stop, suggest

• Some verbs can be followed by an -ing form or an infinitive with little or no change in meaning: begin, continue, hate, intend, like, love, prefer, start.

• A few verbs (forget, go on, regret, remember, stop, try) change their meaning depending on whether they are followed by an infinitive or an -ing form.
