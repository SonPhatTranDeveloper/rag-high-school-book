LEARN THIS! Infinitives and -ing forms
1 Some verbs can be followed by an infinitive with to or an -ing form, but with a change in meaning.
They stopped talking when the teacher came in.
I saw my friend in town and stopped to talk to him.

2 The verbs feel, hear, see and watch are followed by an object + infinitive without to for completed actions and object + -ing form for ongoing actions.

3 We can use -ing forms in the same way as normal nouns, as the subject or the object of a verb.
