• We can't use would with state verbs. We use used to.

• We do not usually use would with questions and negatives; we use used to.

5.3 Position and order of adjectives

• We can use most adjectives before a noun or after a linking verb (be, become, feel, get, look, seem, smell, sound, taste, etc.).
He's an excellent cook! His cooking is delicious.

• When we use more than one adjective to describe a noun, we use this order:

opinion | size | age | colour | origin | noun
an interesting | small | old | silver | Roman | coin

• There are some adjectives (e.g. alone, afraid, alive, annoyed, asleep, glad) that we do not usually put before a noun. We can use them after a linking verb or use another adjective with a similar meaning.
He lived a lonely life without many friends.

1 Write the adjectives in the correct order.

1 This café serves some (Spanish, tasty) _________________ dishes.
2 He used to own a (big, scary, black) _________________ dog.
3 Have you seen that (new, Mexican, funny) _________________ film yet?
4 We watched as a (silver, huge) _________________ moon rose in the sky.
5 The woman was holding a (tiny, young) _________________ baby.
6 Who owns that (red, French, new) _________________ car over there?
