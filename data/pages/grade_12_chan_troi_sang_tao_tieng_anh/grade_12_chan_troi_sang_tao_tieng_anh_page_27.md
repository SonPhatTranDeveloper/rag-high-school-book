6 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Read the situations from the It drives me crazy! list. Which ones irritate you the most? Add three things to the list.

RECYCLE! Present continuous
We use the present continuous:
a to talk about something happening around now.
I'm watching a film.
b to describe annoying behaviour.
He's always checking his mobile phone!
c for future arrangements.
I'm visiting him this afternoon.

8 Read the Recycle! box and the sentences below. Say whether the questions refer to what is happening now, an annoying habit, or future arrangements.

1 Why does Speaker 1 think that the comments that he's always reading on social networking sites about people's relationships are strange?
2 What is the local cinema doing that will make a bad situation worse for Speaker 2?
3 What is Speaker 3 doing tomorrow to solve his problem with a laptop?
4 What is Speaker 4 reading that she finds funny sometimes, but very annoying at other times?
