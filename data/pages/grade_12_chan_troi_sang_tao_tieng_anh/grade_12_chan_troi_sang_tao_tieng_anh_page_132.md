Unit 8

8.1 Emphasis
• We can make a sentence more emphatic by adding an extra clause to highlight key information.

Normal | Emphatic
You wanted to go to the beach. | It was you (that / who) wanted to go to the beach.
I'd like to meet Lady Gaga. | The person I'd like to meet is Lady Gaga.
He really wants to visit China. | A place (that) he really wants to visit is China.
I'll never understand baseball. | One thing I'll never understand is baseball.
She just walked the second half of the race. | All she did was (to) walk the second half of the race.
The fire alarm went off. | What happened was (that) the fire alarm went off.

• We often use It is / was ... to make a contrast.
Gal finished the biscuits. I didn't.
It was Gal who finished the biscuits, not me.

• After All (I) did was ... or What (I) did was ..., we use an infinitive with or without to.
What I did was (to) call the police.
However, after All that happened was ... or What happened was ..., we need a subject and a verb. We can put that before the subject.
All that happened was (that) they decided not to go to the party.

• Nominal clauses starting with that can function as the subject of a sentence.
It upsets me that we're no longer friends.
A that-clause can begin a sentence, but we usually rephrase it with The fact that ... .
That we're no longer friends upsets me. X
The fact that we're no longer friends upsets me.

1 Rewrite the sentences with an extra clause at the start for emphasis. Begin with the words in brackets.

English is my favourite subject. (It's English ...)
It's English that is my favourite subject.

1 The girls' team won the quiz. (It was ...)

2 My parents stopped me from going out. (What happened ...)

3 Frank cycled to the river. (What Frank ...)

4 She gave them her opinion, that's all. (All she ...)

5 The Egyptians built the Pyramids. (It was ...)

6 We just need five more minutes. (All we ...)

2 Rewrite the sentences, emphasising the underlined words. Begin with the phrases below.
One idea   One person   One thing   The country
The film   The food

1 I can't stand having a cold.

2 Neil will definitely know the answer.

3 I'm really interested in going to Thailand.

4 I really enjoyed The Hunger Games.

5 She prefers Italian to Chinese.

6 He suggested having a barbecue at his house.

8.2 Mixed conditionals
• Mixed conditionals are a mixture of second and third conditionals and refer to hypothetical situations. Remember that second conditionals refer to the present or future, and third conditionals refer to the past. Mixed conditionals occur when the time reference in the if clause is different from the main clause.
If I had eaten breakfast, I wouldn't be hungry now!
past (3rd conditional)     present (2nd conditional)
If I hadn't spent all my money, I'd come with you for pizza.
past (3rd conditional)     future (2nd conditional)
If I could drive, I would have taken you to the station.
present (2nd conditional)     past (3rd conditional)

• The choice of verb forms in mixed conditionals depends on the time reference:
• If we are referring to the past in the if clause, we use the past perfect (simple or continuous) as we would in a third conditional; if we are referring to the present in the if clause, we use the past simple as we would in the second conditional.
• Similarly, if we are referring to the past in the main clause, we use would have + past participle, as in a third conditional; if we are referring to the present or future in the main clause, we use would + infinitive, as in a second conditional.

Past regrets
• To talk about past situations that we would like to have happened differently, we use the following structures with the past perfect:
I (really) wish ...   If only ...
I'd much rather ...   I'd prefer it ...
