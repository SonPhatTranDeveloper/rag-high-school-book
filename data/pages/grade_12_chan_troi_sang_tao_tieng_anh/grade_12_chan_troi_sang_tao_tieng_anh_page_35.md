2H Writing
A for and against essay
I can discuss both sides of a topic.

There are many internet forums and chat rooms for young people where they can discuss their personal problems with their peers. There are both advantages and disadvantages to looking for solutions in this way.

The first advantage of the internet is the huge amount of information on it. You can find an answer to any question you have, provided that you search correctly. And no one can deny that chat rooms can be very supportive and can help you to feel better. Even if you feel you are the only person with your particular problem, you will soon realise that there is always someone else who feels the same way.

So are there any disadvantages to using the internet in this way? Although it is true that there is a lot of information online, we should also remember that it is not always accurate. Moreover, teenagers in chat rooms are not necessarily the best judges of a situation. Even if you get advice, it may not be the most helpful advice you could receive. Finally, the internet is impersonal. People who you chat to online don't know you well, so they won't understand your particular situation.

In conclusion, even though the internet can be helpful when you have a problem, I don't think it is a substitute for speaking to the people in your life who know and care about you. Young people shouldn't forget to talk to the people that they have a real relationship with.
