A. Some holidays are celebrated in honor of family members like mothers or fathers. In Viet Nam, June 28th is a day for the whole family. Although Family Day (or Vietnamese Family Day) is not an official national holiday, it is very popular and widely celebrated throughout the country. Its aim is to honour and spread traditional family values, and provide an opportunity for family members to get together, and also connect with their cultural roots.

B. Viet Nam, as a nation, prides itself on preserving its core cultural ideals, with a profound emphasis on the enduring values of family loyalty and harmony. In Vietnamese culture, the family is viewed as a unit, and children are expected to demonstrate the utmost respect to their parents. Family Day was established on June 28th, 2001, by the Deputy Prime Minister as a reminder of these values.

C. Various cultural activities are organised in cities all across Viet Nam. This year's celebrations are themed 'Peaceful Family, Happy Society', and include sports, cooking and singing contests. The event will also feature educational seminars on family values and parenting skills, as well as workshops on financial planning and career development. Families can participate in fun games and activities such as scavenger hunts, obstacle courses, and relay races that promote teamwork and bonding. The highlight of the day will be a concert featuring popular local artists, where families can enjoy live music performances and spend quality time together. The Family Day celebration is truly an opportunity for families to connect with each other in a meaningful way.
