2C Listening
Keep calm!
I can understand emphasis.

1 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Discuss how you would feel and what you would do in these situations.
1 You have just ridden your bike into another cyclist who pulled out into the road in front of you without looking.
2 You have just said something negative about a friend without realising the friend was right behind you.

2 Read the text. Which pieces of advice could be useful to each situation in exercise 1? Why? Which do you think is the best piece of advice?

WHAT TO DO IN A CRISIS

Whenever you face a stressful situation, your brain sends alarm signals to your body and causes your heart to beat faster and your muscles to tense in preparation for immediate action. However, this reaction can often prevent us from thinking clearly about the best thing to do.

A good skill you can develop is the ability to react calmly in a crisis. By being aware of your body's stress response and training yourself to ignore that initial flood of emotions, you can make decisions based on clear-headed analysis.

1 Remember to breathe – this is easy to forget when you are alarmed or enraged. And breathe deeply! A calmer body helps create a calmer mind.

2 Focus on the moment – don't think about what should have been done differently. Concentrate on solving the immediate problem.

3 Think positively – positive self-talk in a crisis is often helpful. For example, telling yourself how brave you are can help you overcome your fear.

Listening Strategy
When you listen, pay attention to the words that the speaker emphasises. Usually, a speaker uses emphasis:
1 to highlight new or important information, for example: I've lost my bag. It's a cotton bag with stripes.
2 to contrast two alternatives, for example: Was it black or brown?
3 to contradict what someone else has said, for example: Well, that's not my bag.

3 1.16 Read the Listening Strategy. Then listen to five dialogues. Which words are emphasised in each? Which reason (1–3) is it?

4 Look at the lines of dialogues. Decide where the emphasis should go and why.
1 Do you want to call the police or the fire brigade?
2 A Do you live at number 7 Duncan Drive?
   B No, I live at number 11.
3 Are those the burglar's fingerprints or mine?
4 I can't find my ring. It's a diamond ring, and it's very expensive.
5 A You say you left the house at quarter to eight?
   B No, it was quarter past eight.
6 I saw a van outside. A blue van. A dark blue van.

5 1.17 Listen and check. Practise the sentences in pairs.

6 1.18 Listen to a dialogue between two friends. Choose the correct answers (a–d).
1 George doesn't believe that
   a Gemma is telling the truth.
   b Gemma saw Sarah stealing from Alex.

2 What would you have done if you had been in Gemma's situation in the classroom?
3 Do you think that George and Gemma decided to do the right thing?
