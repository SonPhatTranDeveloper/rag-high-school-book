Modals in the past
I can use modal verbs to talk about past actions.

1 Look at the photo. Where do you think this is?

2 Listen and complete the dialogue.
Jo: Hi, Tom. How was your trip to Japan?
Tom: It was a disaster! I _____ read about their customs beforehand – then I _____ not have embarrassed myself so badly.
Jo: Why? What happened?
Tom: Well, Aki's parents took us to dinner one night. I had a really bad cold. Aki _____ have told me not to blow my nose in public! Everyone kept staring. They _____ have thought I was so rude! When Aki told me later, I felt terrible about it.
Jo: I'm sure you needn't have done. How could you have known?
Tom: Anyway, I bought a gift for Aki's parents. I sent it on Monday, so it _____ have arrived by now. I probably didn't need to send them anything, but I really wanted to apologise.

3 Read the Learn this! box. Match the modal verbs from exercise 2 with the rules.

LEARN THIS! Modals in the past
a We use may (not) / might (not) / could have + past participle to speculate about the past. We don't use couldn't have + past participle in this way.
She might have been worried about something.

b We use should / shouldn't have + past participle or ought (not) to have + past participle to say what the right or wrong way to behave was.
He shouldn't have left early. He ought to have stayed.

c We sometimes use an exclamation with might have + past participle or could have + past participle (but not may have + past participle or negative forms) to tell somebody how we think they should have behaved.
You might have offered me a biscuit! I was starving!

d We use must have + past participle and can't / couldn't have + past participle to make logical deductions about the past.
They can't have known about the meeting.
They must have misunderstood your email.

4 Underline the incorrect modal verb and replace it with a more suitable one. Sometimes more than one answer is possible.
1 They mustn't have seen Max – he's away on holiday.
2 Joe knew about the strike. He must have warned me!
3 I couldn't have yawned when Tim told that story. It was a bit rude of me.
4 It was so noisy. It's possible he ought not to have heard us.
5 I emailed Erin a week ago, so she can't have read it by now.

5 Read the Look out! box. Then find examples of needn't have and didn't need to in exercise 2.

LOOK OUT! needn't have / didn't need to
1 We use needn't have + past participle to say an action that was done was unnecessary.
The café isn't open yet. I needn't have got here so early!

2 We use didn't need to + infinitive to say an action was unnecessary, whether or not it was done.
The bus stopped nearby, so I didn't need to walk far.

6 Look at the sentence. Are both verbs correct, or only one? Explain the difference between them.

1 Dan looks tired. He _________ (sleep) badly last night.

3 I'm not certain, but I _________ (leave) my passport at home.
4 The restaurant's empty. We _________ (book) a table after all.

2 My brother thinks he saw a ghost yesterday.
3 I haven't got any money at all this month.
