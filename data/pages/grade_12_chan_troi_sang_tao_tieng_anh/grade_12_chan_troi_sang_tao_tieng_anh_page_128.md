Unit 6

6.1 The passive
• We form the passive with the verb be and the past participle of the main verb. The object of an active verb can become the subject of a passive verb.
They haven't found a cure for colds yet.
→ A cure for colds hasn't been found yet.
• We use the passive when we do not know or do not want to say who or what is responsible for the action.
This photograph was taken in India.
• If we mention the agent, we use by:
Enormous public baths were built by the Romans.
• With verbs that often have two objects (ask, award, give, offer, owe, pay, send, show, teach, tell, etc.), either object can become the subject of a passive sentence.
They gave me my money back.
→ I was given my money back.
→ My money was given back to me.
It is much more common for the indirect object (usually a person) to be the subject of the passive sentence (example a above).
• We use the past continuous and present continuous forms of the passive, but not other continuous forms as they sound unnatural.
A celebration is being planned.
→ A celebration has been being planned. X
→ They have been planning a celebration. ✓

6.2 The passive: advanced structures
Verbs like believe, consider, expect, know, report, say and think are often used in passive constructions, especially in formal language.
• We can use an impersonal construction with it + passive:
it + passive (present or past) + that...
It was believed by many people until the 19th century that tomatoes were poisonous.
It is now known that they are not.
• Alternatively we use a passive construction with an infinitive:
subject + passive (present or past) + to do / to have done.
Tomatoes were believed to be poisonous.
• We can use an impersonal construction with there + passive (present or past) + to do / to have done.
There are estimated to be 100,000 people at this weekend's festival.
If the sentence refers to a present belief about a past event, we use the present simple passive followed by a perfect infinitive (to have done).
The thief is believed to have escaped to Scotland.
• We can use passive structures with present and past forms of modal verbs.
The lights should be switched off during the play.
• Verbs that are followed by an infinitive or gerund can also be followed by a passive infinitive or gerund.
Everyone likes to be praised.
I love being given surprise presents!
