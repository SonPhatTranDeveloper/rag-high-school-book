Reporting verbs
I can report what people have said in a variety of ways.

1 Read the news report and answer the questions.
1 What has the man been accused of doing?
2 Can you give examples of similar telephone or internet scams?

Last night, police arrested a man for using social media to obtain people's phone numbers. Martin Wheeler, 41, had phoned a number of people and apparently convinced them that they had won a free gift. He asked them to provide their financial details. Wheeler has admitted that the free gifts didn't exist, but has denied that he actually stole any money. He claimed that he'd been trying to raise awareness of the dangers of giving away their details. Police have warned the public never to make personal or financial information available to others unless absolutely certain that they are genuine.
