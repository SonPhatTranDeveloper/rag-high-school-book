Presentation
I can discuss the link between technology and crime.

1 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Discuss the questions.
1 Have social media, and modern technology in general, created any new kinds of crime? If so, what are they?
2 Have they created any new ways to fight crime? If so, what are they?

2 Read the news reports. In what two different ways did Facebook help to catch criminals? Which story does the photo belong with?

BURGLAR LEAVES HIS FACEBOOK PAGE ON VICTIM'S COMPUTER
MARTINSBURG - The popular online social networking site Facebook helped lead to a burglar's arrest after he stopped to check his account on the victim's computer, but forgot to log out before leaving her home with two diamond rings.

Fugitive caught after updating his status on Facebook
Maxi Sopo was living the dream of a fugitive abroad, kicking back on the beaches of Cancun by day, partying in the clubs by night. Then he did two things that are never a good idea when you're on the run from the authorities: he started posting Facebook updates about how much fun he was having - and he added a former Justice Department official to his list of Facebook friends.

5 Work in pairs. Look at the task, news report and headline below. Choose two of the prompts each and make notes. Then work together to add details and examples to your notes.

Talk for about one minute about how mobile phones can lead to crime and/or be used to fight crime. Think about:
• victims of smartphone theft and/or mugging.
• phone-related fraud, scams, identity theft, etc.
• crimes and criminals captured on camera.
• using phones to report crime / call for help.

Caught on camera
A security firm has developed an app that will email victims of smartphone theft a photo of the person who has stolen their phone. The photo, known as a "theftie", is taken when an incorrect password is entered, and is emailed to the phone's owner together with a map of the smartphone's location.
