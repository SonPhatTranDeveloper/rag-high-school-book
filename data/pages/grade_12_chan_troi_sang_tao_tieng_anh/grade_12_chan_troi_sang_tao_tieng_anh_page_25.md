# Review Unit 1

## Reading

Read the text. Match sentences (A–F) with gaps (1–5). There is one extra sentence.

### Identical twins

Identical twins are born when an egg divides into two, resulting in the birth of two children with identical genes. Some believe, however, that there is also a close connection between twins in the way they think, not just in the way they look. Twins finish each other's sentences, and share the same tastes in clothes or music. Some have argued that identical twins have mysterious, even psychic, powers.

Although many identical twins claim to know what the other is thinking, there is no evidence to suggest that this is because of special powers. Most of us have met up with a brother or sister, or close friend, and immediately asked, 'What's wrong?' because we have unconsciously recognised, in their facial expression, that they are upset in some way. Signs we would miss in a stranger's behaviour are instantly obvious in the way those close to us act. It is hardly surprising that twins notice the way their brother or sister's facial expressions or body language gives away how they feel. Indeed, the closeness of their bond is likely to improve this ability over the years.

The media is full of stories in which a twin senses her brother or sister to be in trouble. Damien Croft developed a bad headache one evening and, concerned, felt the need to phone his brother to check if everything was OK. When there was no reply, he drove to his brother's home, only to find him unconscious, having had an epileptic fit and fallen from a ladder while decorating. On the face of it, his sixth sense had saved the day. Damien knew his brother was decorating, and knew that he was prone to epileptic fits. Subconsciously concerned, he had just imagined the worst-case scenario.

A In a recent, widely-reported case, for example, a young man survived a horrific fall thanks to a feeling his twin is supposed to have had.
B We all know such twins are often very similar in appearance.
C The fact that something awful had happened was only a coincidence.
D In contrast, there are many other stories which can be more easily explained.
E In truth, of course, the events might also be explained in more ordinary terms.
F A more believable explanation is that, like any pair of people who have grown up together, they are just good at understanding the thought processes behind what their twin does.

## Speaking

Work in pairs. Compare the photos. Then give your opinion about the importance of sharing hobbies with others. Say whether you think there are differences between sharing hobbies with family and with friends.

## Writing

It is often said that teens and their parents rarely get on well. Write an essay (180–200 words) to give your opinion on this view and suggest advice to help make the relationship better.
