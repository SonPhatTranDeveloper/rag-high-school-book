BRIGHTER AND SAFER

A Dr Melissa Bateson, a psychologist from Newcastle University, secretly conducted an experiment to see if she could change her colleagues' behaviour when it came to paying for their hot drinks. The teachers were expected to put money in a box in the staff room, but nobody controlled how much money each teacher gave. Dr Bateson put a large picture of some flowers on the wall behind the box for a few weeks and then replaced it with one of a picture of a pair of human eyes. At the end of the experiment, Dr Bateson found that teachers paid almost three times more for their drinks when the picture of the eyes was on the wall. She concluded that we are programmed to respond to eyes, even pictures of eyes, and believed that her posters could help combat crime.

B During the 1960s and '70s, industrialised countries suffered an incredible crime wave, and violent crimes such as muggings increased at an alarming rate. What is more, it was expected to get worse. Only it didn't. Instead, it got much, much better. In the 1990s, crime started to fall dramatically, and today it is down by almost 50% across the industrialised world and continues to fall. Triumphant politicians will assert that their policies have cut crime. Actually, regardless of the country's policies, the trend does coincide with the use and subsequent prohibition of tetraethyl lead in petrol, which has been known for years as a cause of aggressive behaviour. Therefore, countries that still use leaded petrol are being urged to stop using it to help improve health and crime prevention.

C After the installation of blue-light street lamps in Buchanan Street, the main shopping centre of Glasgow (Scotland), the local police felt that thieves were committing fewer crimes in Buchanan Street. Statistics proved that the number of recorded crimes had fallen – especially petty crimes such as pickpocketing and bag snatching. Some psychologists claim that blue is a calming colour and reduces people's levels of stress and aggression. Whatever the reason, it seems that blue lighting does deter crime and it has created interest abroad. Many neighbourhoods in Japan have adopted the change and seen crime fall at a similar rate as in Glasgow.
