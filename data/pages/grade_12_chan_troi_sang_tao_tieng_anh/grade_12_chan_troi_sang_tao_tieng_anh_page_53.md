# ANTARCTICA - trip of a lifetime!

Cruise past towering crystal icebergs. Watch a midnight sunset. Encounter pods of whales and colonies of seals and penguins. Tread where few have ever walked!

As the world's driest, coldest and windiest place, it is no wonder that it is our only uninhabited continent. Although it holds 90% of the Earth's frozen water, Antarctica is actually a desert, and conditions are harsh. But it is spectacularly beautiful. With cruise packages to suit all budgets - an eleven-day trip starts from Â£3,700 - you'd be surprised how easy it can be to visit - and how hard it will be to forget!
