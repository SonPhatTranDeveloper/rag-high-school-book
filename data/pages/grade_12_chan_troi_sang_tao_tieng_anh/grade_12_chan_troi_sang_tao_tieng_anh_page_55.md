Laura's TRAVEL BLOG

Thinking of travelling around Europe? Having just completed my own three-month trip, here are my top tips for InterRailing.

InterRailing is one of the best ways to travel. It's easier and quicker than flying and you see some amazing scenery. But it's worth planning ahead:

- Be realistic about money. Make a weekly budget and stick to it.
- Decide which InterRail ticket is best for you. You can visit up to thirty European countries with the Global Pass, or, if you'd rather discover one country at a more leisurely pace, I'd recommend the cheaper One Country Pass.
- Book accommodation in advance. You can find some pretty good deals if you book early.
- Don't pack too much luggage. You'll have to carry it everywhere, so think hard about what you really need.
- Take appropriate clothing. You're hardly going to need a suit or high heels, but you will need comfortable shoes.

1 SPEAKING Read the travel blog and discuss the questions. Give reasons for your answers.
1 Would you like to go InterRailing?
2 Which type of pass would you prefer?
3 Where would you go?

2 Read the Learn this! box. Then find an example of each rule in exercise 1.

LEARN THIS! Adverbs and adverbial phrases
1 Some adverbs have the same form as the adjective: early, fast, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.
A weekly bus pass is cheaper.
I buy my bus pass weekly.

2 Other adjectives ending -ly do not have an adverbial form: friendly, lively, cowardly, motherly, lovely, etc. Instead we put the adjective in an adverbial phrase:
She smiled at me in a friendly way.

3 Some adverbs have two forms: one with -ly and one without: close / closely, deep / deeply, late / lately, pretty / prettily, etc.
The meanings are sometimes very similar:
Let's stay close together.
The policeman watched them closely.
But they can also be unrelated:
The train arrived late.
Have you been abroad lately?

3 Complete the response to the blog in exercise 1. Use each word once to form an adverb or adverbial phrase.
closely daily early friendly late quick
