JOINING THE WORKFORCE

A The world of work has been undergoing dramatic changes. Step by step, robots are taking over manual jobs that used to be done by semi-skilled workers. AI assistants in the forms of holograms have been on trial at Changi Airport and Boston Airport. Their performance as perfectly efficient check-in staff has amazed users. Certain restaurants in South Korea have introduced tablets for self-order and have even made use of maid robots in place of waiters and waitresses. Getting a secure job or a career can't have been more challenging.

B On leaving school, 18-year-olds are faced with one of the toughest decisions of their life: career choice. Which to pursue requires sensible decision basing on their in-depth self-understanding. Guidance from school counsellors and parents together with insights into their potentials from character tests will empower them to make informed decisions. It is also worth noticing that, in this ever-changing world, school-leavers need to be well-prepared for changes and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

C However bewildering career choice may be, it is no more than the beginning of a person's career. To further it, they have no alternative but to become better day by day. In essence, career development is a continual and lifelong process in which they need to specify their goals, boost their own confidence, improve communication skills, and expand personal networking. Actually, university graduation simply celebrates the completion of adults' mainstream education, signifying their non-stop self-improvement.

D Of all the qualities, a person's flexibility will work in this full-of-changes world. Flexibility manifests itself in professional agility, problem-solving skills, change management and innovative thinking. As long as they are not set in their way of thinking, they can easily get a task done.

E AI has been replacing certain blue-collar workers, but it can never establish a role in a field that has something to do with emotional intelligence (EQ). Automated learning machines can repeatedly lecture a subject, but they can never become an inspiring story for students. Robots in hospitals can accurately perform operations, but at no time can they comfort the lonely and suffering patients like a gentle nurse.

F Technology has taken mankind to a world of constant change. School-leavers are expected to improve themselves and own the right skills to meet the social demands.
