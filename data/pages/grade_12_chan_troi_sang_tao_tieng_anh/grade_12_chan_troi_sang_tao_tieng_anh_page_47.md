3H Writing
A blog post
I can write a blog post.

1 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Discuss the questions.
1 Which local festivals happen in your area?
2 What happens there? Do you go to any?

2 Read the task and find the two elements that you are required to include in your blog post.

Your local newspaper published an article suggesting that a local festival should no longer take place. Write a blog post outlining the advantages of the festival and describing a personal experience of it.

Writing Strategy
Make a plan for your blog post so you allow enough space to include every element from the task instructions. Remember to include a good introduction and a summary.

3 Read the Writing Strategy and the blog post. In which paragraphs (1-4) does the writer cover the two elements from the task? How well does the writer follow the advice in the strategy?

4 Read the Learn this! box. Then find an example of each of the structures in the blog post.

LEARN THIS! Sequencing clauses for describing past events
1 For an action which comes before another action:
having + past participle
Having played football, they went home.
after + -ing
After playing football, they went home.

2 For two actions which happen at the same time:
a present participle
Travelling home, they met Mary.
as + past simple
As they travelled home, they met Mary.
Note: the subject of the participle clause must be the same as the subject of the main clause.
NOT After leaving the cinema, it started to rain. X

SAVE OUR FESTIVAL!

1 I was very surprised to read an article in my local newspaper suggesting that the Kingsbridge Festival should no longer take place. The article suggested that the festival costs the council too much money and causes too much disruption to traffic in the town centre. I'd like to outline some arguments against this view.

2 I strongly disagree with the suggestion that there is no value in continuing the festival. Firstly, it has become a local tradition. Kingsbridge has held an annual food and music festival for more than ten years. Secondly, local producers and caterers can sell their food and drink there. And thirdly, after eating and drinking, visitors can stay to watch local musicians showcase their talents.

3 Last year's festival was a memorable experience. As families crowded around the food stalls, the music played non-stop. There was a lovely, friendly atmosphere until night fell. Having arrived later to hear the bands play, the local teenagers just mixed in with everybody else. Looking around, I could see young people, old people and parents with children on their shoulders, all dancing to the music.

4 In my view, festivals like this are good for local trade and advertising. They are also invaluable for bringing and keeping communities together. How can you put a price on that?

5 In your notebook, join the sentences, beginning with the words in brackets.
