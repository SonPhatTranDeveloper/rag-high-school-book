PRONUNCIATION Question tag intonation
Rising intonation on the tag indicates a genuine question; the speaker isn't sure that the statement is correct and requires an answer from the listener.
You like it, don't you? (= Do you like it?)
Falling intonation on the question tag gives the impression that the statement is correct.
You like it, don't you? (= I think you like it.)

Speaking Strategy
It is important to interact appropriately with the person you are speaking to.
• Listen carefully to what the other person is saying and show interest. Use structures like Oh dear..., Oh, I'm sorry..., I didn't realise..., etc. to empathise with the other person.
• Use tag questions like ... don't you? , ... isn't it? , ... are you?, etc. to elicit agreement from the other person. Remember, we use affirmative tags after negative verbs, and vice versa.
