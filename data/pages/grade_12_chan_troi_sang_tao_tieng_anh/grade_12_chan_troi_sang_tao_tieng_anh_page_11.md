Present and future tenses
I can use different tenses to talk about the present and future.

1 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Look at the list of annoying habits. Which annoys you the most?

Someone who:
• always arrives late when meeting friends.
• borrows things, but never returns them.
• always talks about himself/ herself.

2 1.02 Read and listen to the dialogue. Which of the faults in exercise 1 does Andy complain about? Do you agree with the advice Jessica gives Andy? Why? / Why not?

Andy: Well, Tom never asks about what I'm doing. He's always talking about his life and what he's going to do, but he doesn't care about anyone else!
Jessica: Yes, I've noticed that he never takes an interest in other people. Are you going to do anything about it?
Andy: What can I do? That's the personality he's got.
Jessica: Next time you see him, tell him that it annoys you. I'll tell him if you want because it irritates me too!
Andy: Perhaps I should, because his attitude is really putting me off him. If he can't change his behaviour, then I don't see how we can stay friends. Our first lesson tomorrow is English. I'll speak to him then.
Jessica: Good idea. If he's really a good friend, he won't get angry.
Andy: Well, thanks for your advice. I'm playing football this evening, and it looks like it's going to rain, so I'd better go home and pick up my waterproofs. See you.
Jessica: OK. Good luck with Tom!
