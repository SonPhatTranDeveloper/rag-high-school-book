Reading Strategy
When you do a gapped sentence task, look for clues before and after each gap. For example, if a sentence starts with And or Furthermore, it probably introduces additional information.

Other words can be used for contrast (But, However) and consequences or conclusions (So, Therefore).

3 Read the Reading Strategy. Match the sentences (A–E) with the gaps (1–4). There is one extra sentence.
A Not surprisingly, a diet that contained few nutrients and an excess of fat and carbohydrates could only have negative consequences.
B Its aim was to encourage food addicts to beat their addictions with the help of a psychologist and nutritionist.
C One of the first steps was to get rid of her collection of free gifts.
D Parties, picnics and barbecues with friends and family used to be a nightmare.
E The doctor who treated her said she had never seen such an extreme case of food addiction.

A true pizza fan
Few people would disagree that one of the world's most popular dishes is pizza. Twenty-two-year-old Zack certainly wouldn't. He would eat a variety of pizza-based items, including homemade pizza, precooked microwave pizza, and even pizza leftovers from the night before. He was consuming 300kg of pizza a year. As a child, Zack had eaten a wide variety of food. But he became addicted to pizza when he started secondary school. American school meals have often been criticised for the large amount of fast food present on the menu, and pizza is the star dish. Zack even spent all his pocket money on slices of pizza.

Naturally, Zack's family worried about his high-calorie, low-vitamin diet. So did Zack. In an attempt to break his addiction, Zack agreed to appear on a TV programme called Freaky Eaters. [1] It wasn't easy. He had to eat a fish dish, while his brother sat in front of him enjoying ... a pizza! However, Zack met the challenge and has never eaten pizza again.
