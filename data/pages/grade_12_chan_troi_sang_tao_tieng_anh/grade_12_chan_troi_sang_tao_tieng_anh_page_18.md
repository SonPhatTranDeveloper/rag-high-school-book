Articles and quantifiers
I can use articles and quantifiers.

LEARN THIS! Quantifiers
Examples of quantifiers are: a lot of, a little, all, another, both, each, every, few, many, no, several, some, etc.

Most quantifiers can be followed by of + a determiner:
Some of my favourite films are buddy movies. Just a few of these star women.

No and every can't be followed by of; instead we use none of and every one / each of:
None of the main characters are female.

After both and all, we often leave out of before determiners:
All the actors have starred in other films.
Both my parents are film fans.

We use few / little instead of a few / a little to emphasise the smallness of the number or quantity. Compare:
There are a few westerns I really like. The ones with Clint Eastwood are brilliant.
There are few westerns I really like. I just don't find the characters interesting.

SOME BUDDY LOVES YOU!

Buddy movies always have two male friends, often from different backgrounds or with different personalities. They usually face a challenge together during the course of the film, and the challenge (eventually) makes their friendship stronger. They're more popular in the USA than in Europe, and can be aimed at both the old and the young. The earliest buddy movies starred Laurel and Hardy and were made in black and white around a hundred years ago. Nowadays, many are also action films, road movies or westerns - famous examples include Die Hard 3 and 22 Jump Street. In most of them, women only play a minor role, never one of the buddies. In a few films, one of the 'buddies' is an animal!
