LEARN THIS! The passive

1 We form the passive with the verb ¹________ and the ²________ of the main verb. The object of an active verb can become the ³________ of a passive verb.
They haven't found a cure for colds yet. (a cure = object)
• A cure for colds hasn't been found yet. (a cure = subject)

2 If we need to mention the agent, we use 4________.
Enormous public baths were built by the Romans.

3 We use the passive:
a when we do not know (or do not want or need to say) who does something.
b for more formal language, e.g. for processes.
First, the coffee beans are dried. Then they are roasted.
c when we want to focus on the person to whom the action is done, not the person doing the action.

4 We use the 5________ and past continuous forms of the passive, but we do not use other continuous forms.
Hygiene is being improved. ✓
• Hygiene has been being improved. ✗
• They have been improving hygiene. ✓

5 Rewrite the sentences (1–5) in the passive. Match them with rules (2–4) in the Learn this! box. The sentences may match with more than one rule.
1 A doctor has examined me and told me to rest at home.
2 It was in the 19th century that they invented anaesthetics.
3 Scientists are making more advances in medicine every year.
4 They'll stitch the wound now and remove the stitches next week.

A history of hygiene

Ancient ideas of hygiene
The ancient Greeks and Egyptians enjoyed relatively high standards of personal hygiene – they had been taught about the importance of cleanliness by their religious leaders. But it was the Romans who developed the first public toilets and enormous public baths.

19th century developments
Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister's revolutionary ideas about using sterile instruments in clean hospitals were adopted in the 19th century. Before then, up to half of Lister's patients who had survived surgery were being killed by infections spread by germs. Infection and disease haven't been eliminated entirely in our hospitals yet, but they have been significantly reduced.

Today and tomorrow
Although hygiene in developing countries is being improved all the time, 36% of the world's population is still affected by poor hygiene. Furthermore, medical organisations will be challenged in the future by new infections and diseases; the world's population is so closely connected that potentially catastrophic epidemics will be transmitted around the globe in days.

6 Read the text below. Then rewrite the underlined sentences (1–8) in the passive. Decide whether you need to include the agent.

It was called 'The Great Mortality', but today ¹we know it as the Black Death. In 1348, ²rats brought the plague from Asia to Europe. ³The disease killed millions of people. 4The cities were overcrowded with frightened people and 5coughs and sneezes quickly infected them. Similarly, in 2019, 6COVID-19 attacked different areas of the world. 7The virus corona infected millions of people. 8Authorities had to lock down many cities to stop the infection. This virus is still popular but 9vaccines can save patients from danger.
