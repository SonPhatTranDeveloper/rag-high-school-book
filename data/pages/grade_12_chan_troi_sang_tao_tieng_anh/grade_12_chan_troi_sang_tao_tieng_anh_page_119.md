1.4 Quantifiers
• We normally use some in affirmative sentences and offers, and any in negative sentences and questions.
We've got some milk and sugar.
We haven't got any milk or sugar.
Have we got any milk or sugar?
Would you like some milk and sugar in your tea?
• We use any with uncountable and plural nouns in affirmative sentences where the meaning is negative.
He went out without any gloves on.
There is never any snow in the Caribbean.
• We can use any in affirmative sentences to mean it doesn't matter which.
Any songs by Taylor Swift are great!
• We use no (meaning not any) when we want to be emphatic.
There's no need to be rude.
No clubs in town will be open yet.

• We use (a) few with plural nouns and (a) little with uncountable nouns.
He's only got a little free time this weekend.
A few students have already finished the test.
• We use few / little instead of a few / a little to emphasise the smallness of the number or quantity.
He has little money and few friends.
• We normally use whole with singular countable nouns.
We've eaten a whole box of chocolates.
• We normally use all with uncountable nouns and plural nouns.
He listened to all (of) the songs on the album.
Have we finished all (of) the pasta?
• We use both, either and neither to talk about two things.
Both restaurants are quite new.
Neither book is very interesting.
We can get off the train at either stop.
• Most quantifiers can be followed by of and a determiner (the, these, my, etc.): most of the ..., a few of his ..., several of those ..., all of us, each of them, many of, etc. After both and all, we often leave out of before the.
All (of) the children are in the playground.
• However, no and every cannot be followed by of. Instead, we say none of and every one / each of. None of takes a singular verb in formal contexts.

None of the boys in the band are over 20.
None of the boys in the band is over 20. (formal)
