2B Grammar
Comparison
I can make comparisons.

1 SPEAKING Do you think you are luckier or unluckier than other people? What is the luckiest or unluckiest thing that has happened to you or someone you know?

2 What are the rules for forming a) short and long comparative adjectives and b) short and long superlative adjectives?

If you were Costis Mitsotakis, you might consider yourself the world's unluckiest man. Costis was the only person in his village not to buy a ticket in the Spanish Christmas lottery. When they won first prize, everyone except Costis received a share of the total prize of nearly £600 million, so he was the poorest / most poor person in his village that Christmas. But there are other contenders. For example, US park ranger Roy Sullivan was even unluckier as / than Costis. He was struck by lightning seven times in his lifetime – the world record! However, that's nothing like as bad as Britain's John Tyne, who is perhaps the most / more unfortunate of all. At eighteen months old, he accidentally drank disinfectant and had to have his stomach pumped. And the older he got, the worse things became. He's been run over, nearly drowned and had a car crash. John's life has been more accident-filled than you would think possible. But he doesn't think he's unlucky. As far as he's concerned, most of his accidents could have ended a lot more seriously, so he may actually be the world's luckiest man!

LEARN THIS! Comparative structures
1 We usually use more / less and (the) most / (the) least to form comparative and superlative adverbs. However, we add -er and (the) -est to some adverbs.
You should drive more carefully.
He used to drive faster. Now I drive the fastest.
2 We can use the following structure to show that two things change together because they are connected:
The longer he lives, the crazier things get.
The harder I tried, the better my life became.
3 Comparatives often have a clause after than:
She's more upset than she used to be.
He's less unhappy than I imagined.
John swam further than he intended to.
