STARS OF THE vlogosphere

3:11

A Helicopters circled the sky above Piccadilly Circus as the police officers below struggled to control the thousands of fans on the streets outside the bookstore. Who were the thousands of fans waiting for? That latest pop sensation? No, a 'vlogger' – a video blogger.

B What makes vloggers so popular? Successful vloggers share some common characteristics. They are outgoing, quick-witted and spontaneous in front of their webcams. There is also a lot of interaction with the audience and feedback on their videos. This means vloggers can adapt the content of their videos to keep their viewers happy. It is material that is made by young people for young people without any intrusion from media corporations. What is more, thanks to the accessibility of modern technology, the vlogs can be watched anywhere at any time. All these ingredients have created a two-way relationship between vloggers and their subscribers, based on shared interests and trust that cannot be found between the providers and users of other media.

C However, it appears that those shared interests and that trust might become negatively affected by money. Some of the big-name vloggers can earn up to £20,000 for displaying an advertisement on their channel. They also earn a lot for mentioning or reviewing a product in a vlog. About 1,000 vloggers around the world earn at least £100,000 a year from their YouTube income. And profits are sometimes earned at the expense of honesty.

D So, will vlogs go the way of many TV programmes and films? Not according to the vloggers, who emphasise their creative independence over making money. However, Zoella, one of the few vloggers in the public eye in Britain, caused a scandal after publishing a book and claiming that it had always been her dream to write a novel. Shortly later, she had to admit that she had not written it alone and her name was just being used to sell it. Many media experts saw it as a sign that vlogging had lost its innocence and that large media corporations were taking control.
