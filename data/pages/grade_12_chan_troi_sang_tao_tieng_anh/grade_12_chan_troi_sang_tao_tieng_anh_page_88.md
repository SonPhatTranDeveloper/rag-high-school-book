## Reported speech
I can report what people have said and asked.

1 Read the email. Look at the phrases in bold. What were the actual words used by the speakers?

Hi Daisy,
Last week **'my brother said that he had posted some photos on his blog'**. Then **'he told me that some of his friends had left negative comments on the photos, and 'he would not forget them'**. **'I said that he had relied too much on information from social media'**, and that **'he shouldn't spend time reading them'**. **'My mum says that my brother needs support from me'** and **'I shouldn't complain about his dependence on social media'**. What do you think? Eva

2 Read the Learn this! box. Then find examples of the rules in exercise 1.

### LEARN THIS! Changes in reported speech
1 After reporting verbs in the past, the verbs of the original speech move back in time.
'I'll call later.' → She said she'd call later.
2 After reporting verbs in the present, future or present perfect, the tense is usually the same as the original because the time reference is the same.
'Jo's passed her exams.' → He says Jo's passed her exams.
3 Modal verbs are usually unchanged after past reporting verbs.
'I might get a new bike.' → He said he might get a new bike.
4 We make changes to personal and possessive pronouns, determiners like this / that, and expressions when the time reference has changed.
'I'll lend you this DVD tomorrow.' → She said she'd lend me the DVD the next day.

3 Read what Daisy said to Eva. Rewrite the paragraph, changing the direct speech to reported speech.

I have read the comments on your brother's photos. Besides three negative comments, most of the comments were encouraging enough. I guess your brother is too sensitive. I agree that we should not rely too much on other people's attitude on social media, but your mum was right when she asked you to give him more support.

Daisy told Eva that she had read the comments on her brother's photos. She said that...

4 Rewrite the sentences, changing the direct speech to reported speech. Use the reporting verb in brackets. (Each speaker is / was talking to you.)
1 Lee: 'I'm scared of heights.' (tells)
2 Simon: 'You should always tell the truth.' (said)
3 Alison: 'I've never believed in ghosts.' (says)
4 Pete: 'I'll be watching TV this evening.' (has said)
5 May: 'You might see me at the concert.' (told)
6 Jim: 'I won't be late tomorrow.' (says)

### LEARN THIS! Reported questions
1 Tense changes for reported questions are the same as for reported speech. The word order is the same as for statements. We don't use auxiliary verbs.
'Do you like reggae?'
→ She asked me if I liked reggae.
'What time does the concert start?'
→ She asked me what time the concert started.
2 We use if or whether to report yes/no questions.
'Was he late?' → He asked me if the bus had been late.
3 We don't include question tags in reported questions.
'Pat's coming, isn't he?' → He asked me if Pat was coming.
4 To report short answers, we use the auxiliary or modal from the short answer.
'Do you speak French?' 'I don't.'
→ She asked me if I spoke French and I said I didn't.
