Unit 4
4.1 Future continuous, future perfect simple and future perfect continuous

Future continuous
We use the future continuous
• to talk about an action that will be in progress at a specific point in the future.
At three o'clock tomorrow afternoon, I'll be travelling to London.
• to make polite enquiries. Using the future continuous instead of the future simple to ask about somebody's plans makes questions sound more polite and less direct.
Can you tell me when he'll be arriving?

Future perfect simple
We use the future perfect simple to talk about an action or event completed by a specific point in the future.
By the time we get there, the guests will have already arrived.

Future perfect continuous
We normally use the future perfect continuous to say how long an action or event will have been in progress at a specific point in the future.
By the end of this month, I'll have been living in this house for ten years.

We can use the future perfect continuous and the future perfect simple to make predictions about the present.
By midnight, they'll have been travelling for six hours. By midday tomorrow, their plane will have landed.
