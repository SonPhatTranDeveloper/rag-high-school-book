Breaking with problems
I can understand a text about different solutions to city problems.

1 SPEAKING Look at the photos that illustrate two common problems in a city. What do you think are the problems? What are some possible solutions?

2 Read texts (A–C) opposite. Match the texts with the titles (1–5). There are two extra titles.
1 I've got my eye on you!
2 Brighter and safer
3 Driven to crime
4 Feeling blue
5 Politics works!

Reading Strategy
When matching questions with texts, remember that the key words from these questions may not appear in the texts. The same information may be expressed in different words.

2 a fall in the crime rate of under 50%?
3 a fall in crime that was the result of a planned experiment?
4 people claiming that they were responsible for less crime?
5 a crime prevention technique that has interested people in another country?
