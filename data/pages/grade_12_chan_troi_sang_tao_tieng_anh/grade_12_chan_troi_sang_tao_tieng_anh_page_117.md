Some verbs can be state or dynamic depending on the meaning. Only the dynamic sense can be used in continuous tenses.

[Table showing examples of dynamic and state verbs]

1.5 State verbs and dynamic verbs

Dynamic verbs describe actions and can be used in simple or continuous tenses. Compare:
- Dad makes dinner every Friday. (= regularly)
- Dad can't come to the phone; he's making dinner. (= now)
- Jake has watched TV every night this week. (= recently and repeatedly)
- This evening, he's been watching TV for three hours. (= action in progress for a specific period of time)

State verbs describe states, not actions. They are often connected with abstract ideas:
• emotion: care, envy, fear, hate, like, love, mind, prefer, want, etc.
• possession: belong, own, possess, etc.
• thought: agree, believe, disagree, doubt, know, mean, recognise, understand, etc.
• others: contain, cost, depend, fit, matter, need, seem, weigh, etc.

State verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses.
I hate cheese. I hate this song. (NOT I'm hating...)
I've known Eva for years. (NOT I've been knowing...)
I've never understood baseball. (NOT I've never been understanding...)
