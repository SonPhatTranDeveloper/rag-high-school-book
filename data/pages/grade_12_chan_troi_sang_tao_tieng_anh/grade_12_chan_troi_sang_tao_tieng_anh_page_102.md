Mixed conditionals
I can use mixed conditionals.

1 Read the text. Are there any similar charities or events in your country?

In 2015, the charity Comic Relief celebrated its 30th anniversary. They started 'Red Nose Day', a day when people across the UK buy red noses and all of the money from this goes towards Comic Relief. The money raised by Comic Relief helps people living in difficult conditions in the UK and around the world, and it's estimated that over 50 million people would be worse off today if the charity hadn't been set up. The number of children attending primary school in Africa might not have increased by 60 million if the charity didn't exist. In 2015, the British public donated a staggering £78.1 million, bringing the total raised by Comic Relief in its thirty-year history to over £1 billion. But it couldn't have achieved all this if it didn't have the support of the comedians who take part and inspire the public to give so generously.
