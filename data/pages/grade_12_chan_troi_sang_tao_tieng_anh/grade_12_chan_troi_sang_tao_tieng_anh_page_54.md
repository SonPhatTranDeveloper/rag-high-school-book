## Future time clauses

I can use future time clauses.

Hi Emma,

Greetings from Amsterdam! (Although by the time you read this, I'll probably be travelling to Berlin.)

Amsterdam is great! I've done so much already - I'm afraid, I'll have run out of energy before the end of the trip! Luckily, this time tomorrow I'll be on a canal cruise, so that should be a bit calmer. I hope you're not studying too hard - I'll think of you while I'm relaxing on the boat! It's great that you'll be joining me in Paris next month. Guess what? Maroon 5 are touring there. I'll buy some tickets for us. Right, I'd better go, but I promise I'll send another postcard as soon as I've arrived in Berlin.

See you soon!

Josh

1. Read the postcard. What country is Josh meeting Emma in?

### LEARN THIS! Future time clauses

1. We use present tenses instead of will or be going to in future time clauses after these time conjunctions:
   after, as soon as, by the time, immediately, in case, once, the minute, the moment, until, when
   I'll write to you when I have time.
   NOT I'll write to you when I'll have time. X

2. In future time clauses, we usually use the present perfect rather than the future perfect for actions that are complete in the future.
   I'll phone as soon as I've checked in.
   NOT I'll phone as soon as I'll have checked in. X

3. In future time clauses, we use the present continuous rather than the future continuous for actions that are in progress in the future.
   This time tomorrow I'll be sunbathing. I'll think of you while I'm enjoying the sun!
   NOT I'll think of you while I'll be enjoying the sun! X
