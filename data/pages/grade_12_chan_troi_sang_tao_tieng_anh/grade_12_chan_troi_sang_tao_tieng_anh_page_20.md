# POWER OF CONNECTION

"They tried to escape technology, to stay away from that and still have relationships with fellow humans. Very difficult."
Arthur Miller

Technology can exert its power on almost every aspect of our lives, and personal relationships are no exception. We are now becoming more attached to technological devices and less connected to the people around us or even our loved ones.

We work longer hours on computers, meet fewer friends, text more often, and watch more videos than have a true conversation with friends or family members. Technology enhances relationships at home and at work. Social media link us all together, but we mistake them for a perfect replacement for relationships. It is time we realized that the power of connections is built from our own efforts. Whether we choose to stay technologically or socially connected, we have to spend a considerable amount of time doing activities together, listening, understanding and sharing feelings. This helps strengthen our mind and body, keeping us away from isolation and loneliness.

It is not difficult to balance between connections through technology and those through real interactions. We can start by nurturing the relationships within our family. We should spend more time visiting our parents and siblings, besides keeping in touch with them on social media. We should learn to cherish the moments we spend with them. It is never too late to strengthen the bonds with school friends and teachers. Don't hesitate to participate in sports clubs or a hiking trip where we can build up true friendships. And above all, remember that time commitment counts in relationships, so running short of time for connections is impossible.
