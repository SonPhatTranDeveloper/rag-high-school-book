4H Writing
A letter of complaint
I can write a formal letter of complaint.

1 SPEAKING Why do people stay in youth hostels?
What are the advantages and disadvantages?

2 SPEAKING Read the task. What things do you think
might have gone wrong? Discuss and make a list of
possible problems.

On a recent holiday, you and a group of friends stayed
in a youth hostel. You were very dissatisfied with the
experience. Write a letter to the owner saying why you
are unhappy and suggest ways in which he / she could
improve the hostel.

3 Read the letter. Were any of the complaints similar to
your list in exercise 2?

Writing Strategy
When you write a formal letter:
1 divide your letter into paragraphs.
2 in the introduction, explain why you are writing. At the
end, tell the reader what you would like them to do.
3 use formal language and avoid contractions and
abbreviations.
4 use the appropriate phrases to start and finish your
letter, depending on whether you know the recipient
by name.
Dear Sir or Madam > Yours faithfully
Dear Mr Black / Ms White, etc. > Yours sincerely

4 Read the Writing Strategy and find examples of
each of the four points in the letter.

5 Highlight eight formal expressions in the letter.
do not have problems got happen looked at
really think said she didn't say sorry showed her

LEARN THIS! The subjunctive
• We can use the subjunctive in formal English for
requests, suggestions, demands, etc.
• The subjunctive form of the verb is the same as the
base form (e.g. go, be, look, etc.)
• We use the subjunctive in that clauses with ask,
demand, insist, recommend, propose, request, suggest.
He insists that she leave now.
I suggest that the showers be cleaned more regularly.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to complain about our stay at your youth hostel
from 14–16 May.

I reserved a room for four with a shower room, and I received
confirmation of the booking. However, when we arrived, the
receptionist maintained there was no record of my reservation.
I produced my confirmation slip, but she just said that "something
must have been wrong with the website that day".

We were given beds in a fourteen-person room with ten other
people. There was one bathroom for all of us, which was dirty with
no toilet paper. The receptionist took no notice of our complaints.
Then we were supplied with no sheets on the beds! Eventually, we
found some sheets and cleaned the bathrooms ourselves.
There was no apology at any point.

I feel strongly that we were treated very poorly. Firstly, I suggest
that your online booking system be reviewed. Secondly, your staff
should be trained to be more welcoming, and more helpful when
problems arise. And finally, I request that there be sufficient bed
linen, so that other guests are not inconvenienced as we were.

I feel we deserve some compensation and I look forward to
hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,
Gemma Winters
