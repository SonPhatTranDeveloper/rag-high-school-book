Emphasis
I can use sentence structure to create emphasis.

1 Is there a problem with litter where you live? Read the opinions below. Who do you think should be responsible for reducing litter?

A load of rubbish?

One thing I can't stand is all the litter outside fast food restaurants. What they should do is employ extra staff to help clean up the streets. Rob K

The people that I blame are the teenagers – it's them who cause all the problems. The town where I live is full of youngsters, hanging around in gangs and leaving rubbish everywhere – it's a disgrace. Daniel

There's so much plastic packaging nowadays. All the government needs to do is force companies to use biodegradable or recyclable materials in their products and the problem will be solved. Bex

2 Read the Learn this! box. Then find examples of each rule in exercise 1.

LEARN THIS! Emphasis (1)
1 We can emphasise key information in a sentence by:
a adding a clause with It is / was, etc. ... that ... at the start of the sentence.
Joe bought a tablet last weekend.
→ It was Joe who bought a tablet last weekend.
→ It was a tablet that Joe bought last weekend.
→ It was last weekend that Joe bought a tablet.
We often use this structure to make a contrast:
It was a tablet that Joe bought, not a smartphone.
b adding a clause with What.
Kate lost her debit card.
→ What Kate lost was her debit card.
→ What Kate did was lose her debit card.
→ What happened was that Kate lost her debit card.
2 We can use All (that) in the same way as What. It means 'the only thing'.
I just need some money.
→ All (that) I need is some money.
→ They only needed to ask.
→ All (that) they needed to do was ask.

3 Rewrite the sentences (1–7) to make a contrast. Begin with It and emphasise the underlined words.
1 Mia isn't coming shopping with us. Lara is.
2 I haven't got a credit card. I've got a debit card.
3 The first supermarket opened in 1916. It wasn't 1920.
4 Her mum doesn't work in a store. Her aunt does.
5 Many people don't want quality. They want low prices.
6 The sales start on Friday. They don't start today.
7 I blame teenagers for the litter. I don't blame the restaurants.

LEARN THIS! Emphasis (2)
We can start a sentence with a phrase that describes the person, thing, or place that we want to emphasise.
The person (that) you need to speak to is Tom.
One thing (that) I really hate is consumerism.
A place (that) I'd really like to visit is Norway.

4 Read the Learn this! box. Then find two examples in exercise 1. How would the sentences read without the emphatic structure?

5 Rewrite the sentences (1–6). Begin with the words in brackets and emphasise the underlined words.
1 Store loyalty cards have really caught on. (One idea ...)
2 It's the directors of companies who should change. (The people ...)
3 Many European firms are investing in Asia. (One place ...)
4 Greed drives most consumerism. (The thing ...)
5 Plastic packaging creates most waste. (The thing ...)
6 Self-service stores first opened in the USA. (The country ...)

6 Complete the text with the words below. Use each word once.
all   it's   one   that   thing   what   where

The _____ that annoys me most is the litter. Clearly _____ that some people care about is convenience, not the environment. So _____ the government needs to do is prosecute those involved in anti-social behaviour. But _____ the businesses themselves that also need to take more responsibility – for example, the place _____ I usually shop has installed a security camera to deter people from dropping rubbish outside. And _____ they've tried successfully in some places is putting up lifesize cardboard police officers. It seems all _____ some people need is a gentle reminder to act responsibly.

7 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Think of different ways to complete each sentence. Then compare your ideas with other pairs'.
1 The places in my town that have the most litter are ...
2 All we need to do to reduce litter is ...
