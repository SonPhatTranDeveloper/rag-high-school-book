These days, there are many sports competitions that are a physical challenge to the athletes. Well-known examples include the soccer World Cup and the Olympic Games. There are other events, however, that are less well-known, but also very challenging: the Mind Sports Olympiad, and the World Memory Championships. These events are not physical competitions, but mental ones. At the World Memory Championships, for example, competitors have to memorize people's names and faces, or random images.

At an international memory competition in Indonesia in 2017, Yanjaa Wintersoul achieved two world records: one for remembering 212 names and faces in 15 minutes, and one for remembering 354 images in five minutes.

The people who win gold at these events are very good at using their minds and their memory, but anybody can improve their memory. One method has been known for a long time: the "memory journey." A famous Roman named Cicero wrote about it more than 2,000 years ago. The process is simple. First, think about a familiar place or journey, such as the rooms in your home. Next, think of some items to remember and connect each item in your mind to one room, or one location on the journey. Funny, crazy, or interesting connections are best because they are easier to remember. Finally, "walk" the journey in your mind and "see" the items in each location.

Imagine you need to remember a shopping list. You might connect each item to the rooms in your home. For example, you might imagine some bananas "sleeping" in your bed, watching some eggs rolling down your stairs, or swimming across a river of orange juice outside your front door... Then, when you go shopping, you "walk" from your bedroom to your front door in your mind and "see" what you need to buy.

memorize (v) to learn something so you remember it perfectly
random (adj) happening without any regular pattern and without anybody choosing or deciding it

The "memory journey" method has been used for centuries as an effective way to enhance memory skills.
