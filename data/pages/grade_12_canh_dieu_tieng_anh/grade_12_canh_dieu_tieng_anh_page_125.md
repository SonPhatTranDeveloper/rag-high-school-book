Noun Clauses

Noun clauses act as nouns in a sentence. They usually follow this pattern: wh- word + (subject) + verb + (object).

The detectives did not know who did it, but they did know when and where it happened.

Noun clauses can act as the subject of the sentence when they come before the verb.

Where it took place is a complete mystery. Why she committed the crime is unknown.

Noun clauses can act as an object when they come after a verb or a preposition.

I found clues that explained why he did it, but I have no ideas about how it happened.

Read the information about noun clauses. Then, underline the noun clauses in the text in A and the conversation in C. Finally, compare your answers in pairs.

Conversation

Hanna: Definitely! She's one of the best-selling writers in history. Her most famous (2) __________ is a (3) __________ called Hercule Poirot, who is great at finding (4) __________ and other kinds of evidence.
José: Oh, it's a mystery story? I don't like those. I can never figure out who did it!
