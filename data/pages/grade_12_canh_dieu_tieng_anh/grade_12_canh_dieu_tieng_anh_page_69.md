COMMUNICATION SKILLS: Giving Advice

When people are in a difficult situation, other people may give them advice. For advice about emergency situations, it is common to use imperative clauses.
Cover your head.
Move to a safe area.
Imperative clauses are very strong and direct, especially in spoken English. In non-emergency situations, it is more common to give advice using specific expressions or modals.
