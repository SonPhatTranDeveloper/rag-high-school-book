COMMUNICATION SKILLS: Describing an Object

When you describe an object, your goal is to help other people get a picture of it in their minds. To do this, you need to describe details such as the object's shape, size, weight, color, the material it's made from, and so on. If the object has special or unusual features, you should describe those as well.

If you are not certain about specific details or not sure how to describe a feature, use vague language in your description:

It's about as big as a baseball. / It weighs roughly two pounds.
It seems to be made of metal. / It's a sort of reddish-gold color.
It has something that looks like eyes on the front. / It has little round things that stick out.

GOAL CHECK Describe Physical Objects

Think of two objects you know well. For each object, write a description that does not mention their name. Write 120–150 words. Use the descriptions in A as a guide. Present your descriptions (180–200 words) to the class without using your notes. How many of your classmates recognized the objects that you described?
