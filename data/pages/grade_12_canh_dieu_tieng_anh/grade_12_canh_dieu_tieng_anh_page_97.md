Grammar (See Grammar Reference p. 153)

Tag Questions

Use tag questions to check information or confirm an opinion. Add a tag to turn a statement into a yes / no question.
If the main part of the sentence does not have an auxiliary verb, the question tag uses an appropriate form of do.

He's very competitive.
→ He's very competitive, isn't he?
You like playing soccer.
→ You like playing soccer, don't you?

For positive statements, add a negative tag. For negative statements, add a positive tag.

They're very athletic, aren't they?
I probably won't win, will I?

To avoid confusion, don't answer tag questions with just "Yes" or "No." Instead, answer with a full sentence.

A. You don't like golf, do you?
B. Actually, yes, I do.
C. No, you're right, I don't.

Use rising intonation with tag questions when you are not sure if the answer will be yes or no. Use falling intonation when you are sure (or fairly sure) what the answer will be.

They can't win, can they? (unsure)
He's playing well, isn't he? (sure)

Circle the correct tags. In pairs, take turns asking and answering the questions.

1. You were a professional tennis player, have / haven't / were / weren't you?
2. You have never won a world championship, are / aren't / have / haven't you?
3. You enjoy watching sports events on TV, can / can't / do / don't you?
4. Most athletes should have big muscles, will / won't / should / shouldn't they?
5. Sports leagues can make a lot of money, do / don't / can / can't they?
