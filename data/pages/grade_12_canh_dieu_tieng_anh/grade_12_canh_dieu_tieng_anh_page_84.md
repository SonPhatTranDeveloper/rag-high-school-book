A. In pairs, discuss which paragraph (a–f) describes each part of the graphic (1–6).

a. A few hundred years ago, the first steam vehicles were built. Steam allowed people to travel farther and faster than ever before. Then oil was discovered as a useful fuel. This led to the development of cars and other motor vehicles.

b. After all these developments, what will human transportation be like in the future? Will self-driving vehicles and flying cars become common? Will humans explore Mars or other planets? Time will tell.

c. After the wheel was developed, carts and other kinds of simple vehicles could be built. These could be used for travel by several passengers at the same time.

d. In the early twentieth century, the first aircraft were built. Cars, buses, and trains became faster, too. This allowed people to live in one place and commute to a job in a different place. In the middle of the twentieth century, scientists developed rockets to launch satellites into space.

e. Later, people learned to ride animals such as horses or camels. Riding made it easier to reach a distant destination, but many journeys still took a long time.

f. The earliest humans could only get around by walking or running. As a result, places that were a long distance away could not be reached easily.

"Do you know what commute means?"

"Yes, it means to travel regularly from your home to work and back."
