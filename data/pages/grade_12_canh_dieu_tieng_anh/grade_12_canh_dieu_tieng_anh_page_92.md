Don't trust the other reviews *

There are a lot of great things to say about the resort. The staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the facilities were top quality. Why not four stars? We came at the wrong time of year. In winter, I'm sure there's a lot to do. In summer, though, a lot of shops and tourist attractions are closed, which is too bad.

We chose this hotel based on a lot of really positive four-star reviews. I think people must have been paid to write those reviews because the reality was very different. The rooms were dirty, the food was bad, the pools were closed, and the service was terrible. I can honestly say it was my worst vacation ever, and I wish I had stayed home. I'm going to try to get my money back.

I discovered this hotel online but couldn't find any reviews, so I took a chance... and I'm glad I did. It was fantastic. It's smaller than the other hotels on the beach, but the staff really try to make sure each guest is happy. The rooms aren't large, but they're quiet and beautiful. And the views from the windows are just incredible. It was so amazing that I'm going back next year, too!
