Infinitives and -ing Forms 1

When two verbs are used together, the second one often is an infinitive (e.g., to do) or an -ing (e.g., doing) form.

Some verbs take only infinitives. For example, agree, decide, hope, manage, plan, promise, and wish.
They promised to buy her a book.

Some verbs take only -ing forms. For example, avoid, delay, dislike, discuss, enjoy, finish, and (don't) mind.
We enjoy staying here each year.

Some verbs can take either infinitives or -ing forms with almost no difference in meaning. For example, continue, hate, like, love, and prefer.
I prefer eating at home, but my partner prefers going out.

4. □ infinitive □ -ing form
5. □ infinitive □ -ing form

GOAL CHECK Express Degrees of Liking

Complete the tasks.

1. In pairs, put these expressions in order from most like to most dislike: be mad about, like, dislike, don't mind, can't stand. Then, discuss whether an infinitive, an -ing form, or both can come after each expression.

2. Work individually. Use each expression in a sentence about your own likes and dislikes.

3. Interview your classmates to find someone who:
• can't stand something you like.
• likes something that you dislike.
• doesn't mind something that you dislike.
• is mad about something you don't mind.
