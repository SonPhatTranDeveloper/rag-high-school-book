In sports, we expect that athletes and teams will play to win. In some unusual cases, however, trying to lose may be better. In the 2018 FIFA World Cup, England played Belgium. The winners would play great teams like Brazil or France in future games. The losing team would still advance but would play less famous teams like Denmark or Sweden and therefore, would have easier games and more chances to win the whole competition. In the end, Belgium won the game. But for England, losing did not feel like failure. The team easily reached the semi-final, the country's best result in almost 30 years.

In some North American sports leagues, losing can also mean winning. However, a team must lose many games in some years in order to win in future years. The reason is something called a draft. Each year, every team gets a chance to add the best young players from around the country. Teams with very bad records get the first chances to pick players. So, losing a lot gives a team a good chance to draft a great young player.

With drafting, a team can add several top players to improve very quickly, or even to become good enough to win a championship. In baseball, for example, the Chicago Cubs lost game after game for years. However, the drafted players afterward were so good that the Cubs won the baseball World Series in 2016.

When a team tries to lose often in order to draft great players, it is called "tanking." This is sometimes unpopular with fans, but it is not against the rules. To do this, trading players is a common way. A tanking team can trade its best players to other teams. In return, it can get extra draft picks.

Tanking is a controversial practice as it goes against the principles of fair competition.
