# A GOAL Speculate about the Future

## Vocabulary

A Read the text. In groups, discuss whether computers really are the most important invention in history. What other important inventions are there?

What is the most important invention in history? Some people say it is the computer. This makes sense: we can use them for many purposes, to find solutions to many problems, or to achieve many outcomes.

We think of computers as modern machines. After all, using computers every day is a habit for many of us. However, they have a surprisingly long history. In 1822, a mathematician called Charles Babbage designed a device that could do math. He did not have enough money to build it during his life. However, the Science Museum of London used his plans to build one in the 1980s. The experiment was a success and this early computer worked perfectly.

The invention of microchips in the 1950s was also a significant development. These small parts have led to electronic computers that keep getting smaller, faster, and more powerful. What will happen next? How will people use computers to develop their creativity and improve the world? Nobody knows, but it will be interesting to find out.

Charles Babbage's invention was designed to complete complex mathematical problems.
