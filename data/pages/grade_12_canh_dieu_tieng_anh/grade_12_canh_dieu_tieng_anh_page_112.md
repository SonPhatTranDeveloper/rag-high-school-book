# GOAL Talk about Common Injuries

## Language Expansion: Common Injuries

Our world is usually safe, but some common activities can be dangerous. For example, doing sports can lead to injuries. If a hard ball hits a person, it can cause a bruise. The skin will change color and be painful to touch. If a person who is running falls down, she may get a scrape on her knee or elbow where the skin is rubbed off. And if the person twists an ankle, an elbow, or another joint, he may have a sprain. Cooking is another activity that can be dangerous. A person may get a cut if he is not careful when using a knife. And touching a hot pan can cause a burn. Finally, being in an accident often causes an injury. If a person falls off his bike, for example, it is possible that he will have a break, or fracture, in a bone.

Ankle sprains are common injuries in a variety of activities.
