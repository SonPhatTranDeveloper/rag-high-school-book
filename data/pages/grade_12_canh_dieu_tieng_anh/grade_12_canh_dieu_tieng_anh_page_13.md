Present Perfect and Present Perfect Continuous

The present perfect (has / have + past participle) and the present perfect continuous (has / have + been + present participle) both refer to past situations connected to the present.

I have lived here for a long time.
I've been living here for a long time.

In most cases, use the present perfect rather than the present perfect continuous:
1. to focus on the result of a finished action / event or to emphasize the number of times we have done something.
2. to describe things that happened at an unspecified time in the past.

It has stopped raining. (The sky is clear now.)
He has read this book three times.
She's just started a new job.

In most cases, use the present perfect continuous rather than the present perfect:
1. to focus on the length of an action / event which may or may not be finished.
2. to describe past actions that are still continuing.

It's been raining since yesterday.
He has been reading the book for two hours.
She's been working for this company for ten years.

Some time expressions are common with both forms:
1. Use for to say how long something has continued.
2. Use since to indicate when something started.

We've worked together for years.
We've been working together since 2015.
