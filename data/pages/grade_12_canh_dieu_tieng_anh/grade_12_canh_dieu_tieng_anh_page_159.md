# UNIT 6

## Lesson A

### Reported Speech
In indirect speech, the tense of the original verb usually shifts back in time. For example:
• (present) do or doing → (past) did or was doing
• (present perfect) have done or have been doing → (past perfect) had done or had been doing
• (past) did or was doing → (past perfect) had done or had been doing
• (modals) will do / can do / shall do → ("past" modals) would do / could do / should do

However, there is no change in these cases:
• when the original verb is in the past perfect
• or for "past" modals like could, would, should, might
• if the original statement is still true or has not happened yet.

Reported questions use normal word order and do not end with a question mark. To report wh- questions, use the wh- word to introduce the reported speech. To report yes / no questions, use if or whether to introduce the reported speech.

She asked, "When did you do it?"
→ She asked when I had done it.

She asked, "Can you do it?"
→ She asked if they could do it.

"Close the door when you leave," my teacher said.
→ My teacher told me to close the door when I left.

Reported commands, orders, requests, and instructions use told sb (not) to do sth. Some other common reporting verbs are ask, order, request, and warn.
