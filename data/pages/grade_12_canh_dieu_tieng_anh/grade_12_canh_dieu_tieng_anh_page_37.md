The Passive 1

The passive (or passive voice) is formed using be + past participle of the main verb.

To turn an active sentence into a passive one, the direct object of the active verb becomes the subject of the passive verb. (For this reason, verbs that do not take a direct object usually cannot be passive) You can add the subject of the active verb to the passive sentence after by as the agent.

Examples:
Pollution is caused by vehicles.
People are affected by pollution.

Pollution causes many problems.
Many problems are caused by pollution.

The passive is more common in formal, written English than in informal, spoken English. The passive is used:
1. to emphasize the object of a verb by making it the subject of the passive sentence.
2. when the agent (the person or thing doing the action) is unknown, unimportant, or obvious.
