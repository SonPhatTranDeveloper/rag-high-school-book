PRONUNCIATION: Sentence Stress for Emphasis of Meanings

When we speak, we can place emphasis on certain words in a sentence to express a specific meaning or emotion. This is called sentence stress. We use sentence stress to make our message clearer and more effective.

• I don't like it. Please stop! (The emphasis probably shows anger.)
• You don't like it? Really? (The emphasis probably expresses surprise.)
• Actually, no, I don't like it. (The emphasis corrects a misunderstanding.)
• Jonah likes it, but I don't. (The emphasis makes the different opinions clear.)

Listen and underline the words that the speaker emphasizes. Then, in pairs, match each example of emphasis to one of the three reasons (a–c) below.

1. "I mean it's not spreading fast."
2. "Hold it upright and put the safety pin... well... pull the safety pin out so your tool is ready for action."
3. "Remember to aim at the base of the fire, not the center or the top..."
4. "Please move the tool from side to side..."
5. "Continue using the extinguisher until the fire is fully under control."

a. The emphasis corrects a mistake the speaker has made.
b. The emphasis contrasts one idea or thing with another one.
c. The emphasis makes sure listeners understand a key point.
