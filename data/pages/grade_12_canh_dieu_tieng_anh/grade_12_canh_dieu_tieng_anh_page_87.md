PRONUNCIATION: Reduced Auxiliaries Are and Have

In spoken English, auxiliary verbs like are and have are usually reduced. In the middle of a sentence, are often sounds like /ər/ (uh), and have can sound like /əv/ (of).
She thinks buses are slow. → She thinks buses uh slow.
We should have taken the train. → We should of taken the train.

E. Listen to these sentences from the interview. Underline the auxiliaries that are reduced. Then, practice saying the sentences naturally.
1. "You have a car that drives itself across the country, and you could have focused on that."
2. "The thing is, cars driven by humans are more dangerous than self-driving cars are."
3. "I'm sure many other people have felt the same way about traffic jams."
4. "So, these vehicles are great because people can work while they travel."

F. In groups, make a list of different vehicles, such as cars, buses, and planes. Then discuss some benefits and problems of using each vehicle. Use reduced auxiliaries when it is natural to do so.
