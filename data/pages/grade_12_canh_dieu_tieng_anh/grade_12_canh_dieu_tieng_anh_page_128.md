# GOAL: Describe Physical Objects

## Communication

### A. Read the two descriptions and look at the photos. Then, in pairs, discuss which text describes which photo.

1. This object looks a little bit like a ball. It has about twelve sides that have holes in them and many small round things that stick out. It seems to be made of a golden metal. It is about 1.6â€“4.3 inches. It was made approximately in the second or third century AD in Europe. There is doubt about why and how people used it.

2. This object looks similar to an airplane. It has something that looks like eyes on the front, wings at the sides, and a tail at the back. It seems to be made of gold. It is roughly 2.3 inches long. It was made in South America almost 1,000 years ago. People are uncertain what it is and why it was made.

### B. In different groups, read the statements and discuss how likely each one is. Then, come up with other ideas.

- It could have been a children's toy.
- It may have been a piece of jewelry.
- It might have been a type of money.
