WRITING SKILLS: Referring to Research

Before writing something or giving a talk, you may need to research your topic first.
• When you research, make sure you use sources (e.g., books or websites) that you can trust. Also, try to find at least two sources to support each point you want to make or fact you want to include; if you have just one source, the information may be inaccurate.
• When you refer to your research when writing or speaking, use either direct or indirect speech to report people's words or opinions. You should also say where you found the information.

1. Choose an artist whose work you like. Research information about his or her life.

2. Using your research notes, write a short biographical profile of the artist. Use the profiles in B as a guide.

GOAL CHECK Produce a Biographical Profile

Choose two of the situations and write short biographical profile of yourself for each situation (100-120 words). Include the appropriate details for the situations you have chosen. When you have finished, share your profiles with a group. Can your partners guess which situations you chose?

• A profile to enter an art competition
• A profile for a job application
• A profile for a social media account
• A profile for a television show audition
