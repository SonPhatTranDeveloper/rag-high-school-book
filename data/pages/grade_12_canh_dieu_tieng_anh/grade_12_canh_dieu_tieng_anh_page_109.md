## Double Comparatives

Double comparatives are a type of comparative construction that includes two comparative adjectives in a sentence. The structure is The + comparative 1 + subject + verb, the + comparative 2 + subject + verb.

Double comparatives are commonly used to express a cause-effect relationship between two things or events, indicating that one action or situation leads to another.

When be is used in double comparatives, it is sometimes omitted.

The longer I stay in a small place, the worse my claustrophobia gets.
The more people are present, the more anxious I feel.

The more people with specific phobias think about their fear (cause), the more frightened they become (effect).
The more traumatic the experience (cause), the stronger the phobia can be (effect).

The more confined the space (is), the more scared a person with claustrophobia (is).

In pairs, make sentences with double comparatives to show cause-effect relationships. Then, make up new situations with your partner.

1. It gets darker. They feel more scared.

2. Although I try hard to ignore my fear of heights, it becomes more overwhelming.

3. You are distracted. The roads can become dangerous for you and other drivers.

4. You worry about public speaking too much. This makes you feel frightened.

5. If I stay in a crowded place too long, I will feel more uncomfortable.

## GOAL CHECK Ask about Personal Fears

In pairs, complete the steps.

1. Think of a phobia each of you have. Do not say it out loud.

2. Take turns to ask questions to find out / learn about each other's fears. Try to use double comparatives if possible.

3. When you find out your partner's fear, repeat steps 1 and 2 with a different partner.

"Are you scared of spiders?"

"Yes, a lot! I always try to avoid spiders, but the more I try to avoid them, the more scared I become."

"The more you worry about your phobia, the worse it can get."

"I agree."
