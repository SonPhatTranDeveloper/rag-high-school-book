COMMUNICATION SKILLS: Giving Instructions

When you need to explain how to do or use something, you can give instructions. Here is some advice for giving clear, effective instructions:

• Giving instructions is like giving advice: you can use the imperative (base form of the main verb without subject), such as: Follow these instructions. The negative imperative is formed using do not (don't): Don't run through the hallway! You can also use modals such as must (not) or should (not).

• If your instructions must be followed in a certain order, it is a good idea to use clear sequence words such as first, second, third, next, after that, and so on.

• For very important instructions, such as safety instructions, use basic vocabulary and sentences so that no one will misunderstand. It may help to imagine that you are giving instructions to a child.

Read the instructions. Then, in groups, complete the tasks.

Follow these instructions when you want to cross a road that does not have a crosswalk. First, find a place to cross where you can see the traffic in every direction. Next, wait by the side of the road. You should not stand too close to the edge. Then, look in all directions and listen. If you see or hear any traffic, wait until it has gone past. Finally, walk directly across the road without stopping.

1. Underline the imperatives and modals. One example has been done for you.

2. Circle the sequence words. One example has been done for you.

3. Discuss whether a child would easily understand these instructions.

Writing

Write clear instructions (80–100 words) about how to do one of these things safely. Use the instructions in D as a model.

• Cook food on a barbecue
• Clean up broken glass
• Cut wood with a saw
• Hike in the mountains

GOAL CHECK Give Clear Instructions

1. In groups, share your instructions from E and discuss how to improve them.

2. Join a new group with people who wrote instructions about the same topic in E. Discuss how to combine your instructions so that you keep the best parts from each.

3. Present your combined instructions to the class.
