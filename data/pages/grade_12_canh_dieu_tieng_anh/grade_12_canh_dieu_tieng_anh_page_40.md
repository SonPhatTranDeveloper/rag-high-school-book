350,000

When we talk about climate change, we often focus on how it affects humans. However, it affects every species on the planet. Saiga antelope, an endangered species, were affected by the effects of climate change in 2015. Around (1) ________ of the animals died over a period of two weeks. This was about 60 percent of a population of roughly (2) ________ saiga. Scientists believed the deaths had been caused by bacteria. These bacteria, normally not dangerous to saiga, can poison the animals when the weather becomes hotter and more humid.

Another example happened in Australia in the summer of 2014. The temperature had climbed to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. It was so hot that thousands of flying foxes, a kind of bat, died. It is estimated that at least (3) ________ of these bats were killed by the heat in a single day. Events like this continue to happen. Early in 2018, a smaller number of flying foxes—about (4) ________—were found dead near Sydney.

B. Work in pairs. One student reads aloud a number from the list in A; the other says what the number refers to.

45,000: The number of bats that were killed by the heat in a single day.
