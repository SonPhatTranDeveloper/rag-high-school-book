Unreal Conditionals

Use unreal conditionals to talk about a situation that is not true, but that could be (or could have been) true if something were different.

Dinosaurs are extinct, but if the comet had missed, they might be alive.

Unreal conditionals have two parts: a condition part and a result part. The order of the parts does not matter, but when the condition part is first, you need a comma.

If an earthquake happened, some buildings might fall down.
Some buildings might fall down if an earthquake happened.

There are two kinds of unreal conditionals:
• To discuss events that you think are unlikely (second conditional).
• To talk about events that are impossible (third conditional).

Many plants would not grow if bees died out.

If dinosaurs had survived, they would have eaten all the humans.

D Underline the examples of unreal conditionals in the text in A. Then, rewrite the examples with the parts in the opposite order.

E In groups, fix the underlined mistakes in these unreal conditional sentences. Then discuss the sentences. How true do you think they are? Why?

1. We might learn more about the past if scientists had discovered more fossils.
2. If the big rock missed Earth 66 million years ago, dinosaurs might have survived.

5. If a scientist stopped climate change, she will become rich and famous.
