Infinitives and -ing Forms 2

Both infinitives and -ing forms can be the subject of a sentence.
Finding out / To find out the information is important.

Infinitives can give more information about some nouns and adjectives.

-ing forms can be the object of a preposition.

Prepositions after Some Verbs

Some verbs often require a preposition before its object:
• Preposition for: ask, apply, care, hope, look, etc.
• Preposition from: benefit, borrow, choose, come, learn, etc.
• Preposition in: believe, excel, invest, participate, succeed, etc.
• Preposition of: accuse, disapprove, dream, make fun, think, etc.
• Preposition on: comment, decide, depend, focus, insist, etc.
• Preposition to: apply, belong, get used, lead, talk, etc.
• Preposition with: agree, collaborate, connect, deal, disagree, etc.
Example: He is looking for a new job with a high salary.

For some verbs, a direct object is needed between the main verb and the preposition.
Example: The police accused him of stealing the car.

Choose the correct preposition to complete each sentence.
1. I'll apply _____ the scholarship next year. (from / to / for)
2. Children benefit _____ reading books and loving literature. (on / from / for)
