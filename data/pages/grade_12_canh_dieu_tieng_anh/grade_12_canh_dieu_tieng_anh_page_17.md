Conversation
F Listen to the conversation.
Tom: I'm doing some research about family histories. Could you tell me about your background?
Julia: Sure! I have a diverse background. I was born here, but my mom comes from Mexico, and my dad's from Brazil, but his father was born in Japan. So I guess I'm half Mexican, one-quarter Brazilian, and one-quarter Japanese.
Tom: Wow! Your family's really multicultural. Why did your parents choose to come here?
Julia: They thought that the quality of life here was so high that they should immigrate.
Tom: This city does have a good quality of life, but it's really expensive. I get so little money from my job that it's hard to live here.
Julia: You're right. House prices are rising so quickly that I've been thinking about moving somewhere cheaper.
