UNIT 5

Lesson A

Unreal Conditionals

Unreal conditionals that refer to unlikely events are often called second conditionals.

If + subject + simple past, subject + would + base form of verb
If I was sick, I wouldn't go to class.

Unreal conditionals that refer to impossible events are often called third conditionals.

If + subject + past perfect, subject + would + have + past participle
If I hadn't gotten sick, I would have come to class.

For both second and third conditionals, using different modals can change the meaning.
If he had a phone, he would / might / could call you.

In questions, use question word order in the result part of the sentence, not in the conditional part.
Would he have helped if I had told him?
He would have helped if had I told him?

In negative sentences, put not in the condition clause or the result clause, depending on the situation. If not is in both clauses, the two negatives result in a positive meaning.
If I had left, I would not have been sad.
(I did not leave, so now I am sad.)
If I had not left, I would have been sad.
(I did leave, so now I am happy.)
If I hadn't left, I wouldn't have been sad.
(I did leave, so now I am sad.)

Lesson C

The Passive 2

Form the negative passive by placing not after be or after the modal.

Notice the word order of questions in the passive.

The money is not usually deposited.
The receipt will not be printed automatically.
Are credit cards accepted here?
Where was the package delivered?

C Underline the passive in the sentences. Then rewrite the sentences in the negative.

1. The instructions were followed by the team.

2. We are affected by changes in our work places.

3. My office space has been reduced.

4. Action is being taken to protect our benefits.

5. We are being given less vacation time this year.

D Rewrite the sentences as questions.

1. Officials have reported that productivity is better.

2. The office is changing our work schedule.

3. All of us are affected by the changes.

4. She has been given a raise.

5. She is being given a promotion.

A Rewrite second conditional sentences as third conditionals and third conditionals as second conditionals. Follow the example.

Example: If he had finished early, he would have won.
â†’ If he finished early, he would win.

1. Would you answer if I called you?

2. If you won some money, what would you buy?

3. If they had lost it, I might have found it.

4. I could have visited if I had had more time.
