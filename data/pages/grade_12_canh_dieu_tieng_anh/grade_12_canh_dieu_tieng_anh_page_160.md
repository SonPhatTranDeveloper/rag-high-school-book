Relative Clauses: Defining and Non-defining

If the relative clause gives information about something that belongs to a person, use whose instead of who or that.

The woman whose art is on display in the gallery is my friend.
The man over there, whose name I have forgotten, is an artist.

If the relative clause gives comments or opinions about the whole clause preceding it, use which, with a comma.

David is choosing painting over the sculpture, which is a wise choice.

C. Underline the relative clauses in sentences 1 to 3. Then complete sentences 4 to 6 with who, whose, which, or that.

1. A potter, who makes pots or other kinds of dishes, is one kind of ceramic artist.

2. The name for a person who takes photographs as their job is a photographer.
