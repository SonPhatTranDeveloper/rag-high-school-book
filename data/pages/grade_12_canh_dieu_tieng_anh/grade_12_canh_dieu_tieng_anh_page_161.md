UNIT 8
Lesson A

Tag Questions
If the sentence has an auxiliary or modal verb, use the same auxiliary or modal in the tag.
She's nice. →
She's nice, isn't she?
He can't do it. →
He can't do it, can he?

In other cases, use the correct tense and negative form of do in the tag.
We liked it. →
We liked it, didn't we?

Match the noun or pronoun in the sentence with a pronoun in the tag question.
The book is new. →
The book is new, isn't it?

In spoken English, you can use right as the tag word. These questions do not have a pronoun.
It's expensive. →
It's expensive, right?
They did it. →
They did it, right?

A Complete these sentences with the correct tag and pronoun. Remember to use a positive tag for negative sentences and a negative tag for positive ones.
