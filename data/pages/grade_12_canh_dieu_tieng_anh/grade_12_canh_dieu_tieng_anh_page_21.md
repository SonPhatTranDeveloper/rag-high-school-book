WRITING SKILLS: Describing Something

One common goal for writing or speaking is to describe something to other people. A good description will help readers or listeners get a clear picture of something in their minds. There are several good ways to include descriptive language:
• use adjectives to describe nouns (e.g., a large, exciting, modern city)
• use adverbs to describe verbs or adjectives (e.g., the house is beautifully designed)
• use prepositional phrases to add details (e.g., a beautiful view of the river)
• make comparisons with other things (e.g., it's larger than a soccer field)

In pairs, find and underline examples of descriptive language in the text.

The Temple of Literature, also known as Van Mieu, is a significant cultural and historical landmark of Vietnam. Located in the heart of Ha Noi capital, the temple is Vietnam's oldest university. It was first constructed in 1070 during the reign of Emperor Ly Thanh Tong to serve as the country's center of learning and scholarship. For centuries, the temple was the site of rigorous exams for students who wished to become civil servants.

The temple is a source of national pride for the Vietnamese. It is known for its stunning architecture, with its distinctive roofs and intricate carvings. The temple complex features five courtyards, each with its own unique features. One of the most famous features is the Imperial Academy, a series of buildings where Vietnam's scholars were trained.

Today, the Temple of Literature is a popular tourist destination. It is particularly popular during the Vietnamese Lunar New Year, when students come to pray for good luck in their studies. The site also hosts various cultural events throughout the year such as traditional musical performances, calligraphy exhibitions, and art shows. For those interested in Vietnamese history, architecture, or culture, a visit to the Temple of Literature is a must.
