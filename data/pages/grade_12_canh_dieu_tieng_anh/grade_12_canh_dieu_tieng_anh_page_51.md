Pronunciation: Assimilation of the Sound /t/

In spoken English, sounds between words can slightly change to make them easier to pronounce. It occurs when sounds blend together as they are nearby in a word.

The sound /t/ becomes /p/ when it occurs before /p/, /b/, /m/.
Examples:
wet paint
light blue
hot meal

The sound /t/ becomes /k/ when it occurs before /k/, /g/.
Examples:
cut cost
bright green

In pairs, take turns saying the following sentences. Circle the assimilation of the sound /t/. Then listen and check your answers.
