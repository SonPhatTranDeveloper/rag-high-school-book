# GOAL: Ask about Personal Fears

## Vocabulary
A Read the text. Tell a partner which of the phobias you have, if any.

A phobia is a stronger fear of something, even if that thing is not likely to cause harm. As the definition suggests, people with specific phobias fear a particular thing, and the more they think about it, the more frightened they become. For example, a person with claustrophobia is scared of being in small spaces, and the more confined the space is, the more frightened they feel. In contrast, those with social phobias worry about the reaction of other people in certain situations, and the more people are present, the more anxious they feel.

Scientists think there are several reasons for specific phobias. In some cases, they develop because of a real danger. For instance, if a child has an allergy to bee stings, she might develop a phobia of bees. This happens because she knows they are a risk to her safety. In other cases, bad past experiences can cause phobias, and the more traumatic the experience, the stronger the phobia can be. A man who has an illness after eating mushrooms might develop fungophobia, for example. Finally, a child who hates injections might develop a phobia of sharp objects that can cause injury.

Specific phobias are rarely a serious problem. A person with a snake phobia may have a small accident running away from a cobra, but may never be actually bitten by one. In contrast, social phobias can be more serious. In the worst cases, people avoid most social situations and hardly ever go out.

People with acrophobia have an intense fear of situations that involve heights.
