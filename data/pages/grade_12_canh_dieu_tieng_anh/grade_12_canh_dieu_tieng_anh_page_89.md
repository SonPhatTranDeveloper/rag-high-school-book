## Indirect Questions

| Indirect questions are questions inside other questions or statements. The last content word usually has falling intonation. | Could you tell me where the station is? I was wondering why you took a taxi. |
|---|---|
| Because people think indirect questions are polite, they often use them when talking to a person they do not know well. | When does the bus leave? (direct) Do you know when the bus leaves? (indirect) |
| Use statement word order in indirect questions, not question word order. | I'd like to know where the subway station is. I'd like to know where is the subway station. |
| Use if or whether in indirect yes / no questions. | Do you know if / whether the flight is on time? |

## GOAL CHECK Ask How to Get Around

Think about how you would answer these questions:
• Where is your favorite restaurant?
• What is a relaxing place you like to visit?
• Where is one place you love shopping?
• What is one fun, free place that you know?

Interview another student. If you know the person, ask direct questions; if not, use indirect questions. If you do not know the place, ask direct or indirect questions to find out how to get there.
