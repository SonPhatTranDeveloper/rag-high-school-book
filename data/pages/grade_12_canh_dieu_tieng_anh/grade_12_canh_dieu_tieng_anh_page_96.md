The sports industry is one of the largest industries in the world. Billions of people enjoy it. For example, they might like playing tennis, or going skiing, or doing yoga. They buy equipment to do these activities in order to become fit and develop strong muscles.

However, the big money comes from professional sports. All over the world, people pay to watch sporting events like the Olympics. Part of the reason why sports are popular is because of the drama. In order for a competitor or team to win a game or a championship, another person or team must lose. Winning brings happiness, but failure brings disappointment.

Because sports are such big business, TV companies pay a lot of money to show them on their channels. In the US, for instance, the National Football League receives around $7.5 billion each year for TV rights. And in some sports, such as soccer, companies pay millions to put their name and logo on a team's uniform. Individual athletes get huge money, too. The very best players—the ones who conquer everyone else to become champions—can make many millions of dollars a year. Unfortunately, few people have the talent or skills to play at this level.
