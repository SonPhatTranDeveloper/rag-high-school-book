Finding a balance between safety and allowing children to engage in age-appropriate risks and challenges is crucial.

According to the "hygiene theory," keeping children too safe may also cause health issues. Some parents do not let their children play with those who have an illness, or they stop their children from playing outside. As a result, their children's bodies are not used to germs or dirt. When these children eat a food that is normal, their bodies may have a dangerously strong reaction. Perhaps that is why more and more children have allergies to foods like nuts or eggs.

So, what should parents do? Some people choose to be "free range" parents who give their children freedom to do things on their own. For those parents who are not ready, there are books and websites that suggest activities children can do with supervision. One of the most famous books is "50

Dangerous Things (You Should Let Your Children Do)" by Gever Tulley. Examples of these dangerous things include letting children drive a car or walk home from school alone.

So, is it true that too much safety can be dangerous? Perhaps the answer comes from Aristotle, the famous Greek writer. He wrote that doing "everything in moderation" leads to the best life.

hygiene (n) keeping your body, home, or workplace clean
germs (n) small living things that can cause an illness
moderation (n) neither too much nor too little of anything
