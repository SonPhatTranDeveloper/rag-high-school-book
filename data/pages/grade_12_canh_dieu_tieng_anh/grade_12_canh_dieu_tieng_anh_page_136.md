GOAL Discuss Educational Choices

Language Expansion: Educational Choices

A Read the text. Then, complete the definitions with a blue word or phrase.

During their lives, people make many choices about their education. In their early years, most children, who have their parents decide their schooling, attend the closest public school. However, parents who can pay for private school may get their children to attend one. If it is a boarding school, their children will have their accommodation provided. Alternatively, some parents may opt to get their children homeschooled, which they believe is the best option. Between the ages of 16 and 18, most students start thinking about going to college and getting a degree. These days, taking a gap year is popular because of life experiences that will help them in the future. When students enroll at a college, they choose which subject to major in: business and economics are popular majors these days. Students also need to choose whether to live on campus or not. Finally, continuing education is growing more popular because people want to learn useful new skills; so, even adults in their thirties or older may need to make educational choices.
