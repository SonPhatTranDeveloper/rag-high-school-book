## PRONUNCIATION: Consonant Clusters

Some English words have clusters, or groups, of consonants next to each other (Consonants include every letter except the vowels: a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y). Longer clusters can be hard to pronounce, especially at the end of words. For example, the cluster -sks in risks. To make pronouncing clusters easier, you might notice that some speakers may drop one of the consonant sounds without realizing it, or may say it very quickly.

Look at these words from the talk. Say all three pronunciations of the word in bold. Which one sounds the most natural? Then listen and check (âœ“) the pronunciation that you hear.

1. With many risks: [ ] risks [ ] riss [ ] riks
2. A few months ago: [ ] months [ ] moths [ ] mons
3. Speed and strength: [ ] strength [ ] strenth [ ] stregth
4. A friend asked: [ ] askt [ ] ast [ ] akt
