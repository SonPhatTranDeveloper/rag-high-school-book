The Future of "Travel"?

Most of us travel each day. We commute to work, visit friends, or go shopping. This kind of travel may be necessary, but it is not always fun. As a result, most of us also look forward to traveling somewhere for a relaxing vacation. In theory, traveling is a wonderful experience. In practice, however, there can be problems with taking a trip.

Cost is one issue. Vacations can be expensive, especially for people with children. Another problem is time. In the modern world, many of us are too busy to take a trip away. And vacations can also be surprisingly stressful. We might have to deal with lost luggage, unfamiliar food, large crowds, noisy hotel rooms, or uncomfortable aircraft seats.

Because of these problems, staycations have become more popular. These are vacations in which you stay at home. During a staycation, people will often visit nearby tourist attractions. And because people do not have to fly to a distant destination or stay in a hotel, staycations cost less than vacations.
