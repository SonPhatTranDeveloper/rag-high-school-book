C Read the email. Then, in groups, put Tommy's suggestions in order from most to least useful. Finally, share your ideas and reasons with another group.

Hi Mia,

I'm glad that you shared your problems with me. I have been thinking about it. I have a few suggestions that might help. First, if I were you, I'd visit the Study Center on campus. I'm sure the people who work there could give you some helpful advice. Second, you should consider reaching out to some nurses. I believe that they can share with you their first-hand experience and honest opinions. Finally, there are some useful websites that helped me choose a career path when I was your age. These websites may help you know a lot more about yourself, especially your personalities, interests, and ambitions. What do you think about these websites?

Making decisions about your future is important, and you don't have to do it alone. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.

Your friend,
Tommy
