PRONUNCIATION: Intonation for Questions and Lists

When saying a list of things, speakers often say or or and before the last item in the list to show that the list is about to finish. In these cases, the first items in the list will have a rising intonation, and the last item will have a falling intonation.

e.g., We don't know when he died, where he died, or how he died.

In some cases, the speaker may leave the list unfinished. In these cases, the last item in the list will also have a rising intonation.

e.g., We don't know when he died, where he died, how he died ...
