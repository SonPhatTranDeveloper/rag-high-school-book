## Adverbial Clauses of Comparison

| Adverbial clauses of comparison are subordinate clauses that compare the relationship between two actions or events. They are used to indicate that one is equal to, greater or less than the other in terms of quality, quantity, or degree. | Female athletes can be faster and stronger than most people think. Grace ended the race as successfully as she had hoped. |
|---|---|
| Adverbial clauses of comparison often start with the subordinating conjunctions "as" or "than". The conjunction "as" is used to introduce a clause after an equal comparison. The conjunction "than" is used to introduce a clause after a comparative adjective, adverb or noun phrase. | Baseball is not as popular as it used to be. The football match was more exciting than the commentator had predicted. |
| In adverbial clauses of comparison, the verb is usually understood and not expressed. In most cases, we use an object pronoun instead. | Female athletes are not paid as much as male athletes. (= Female athletes are not paid as much as male athletes are.) She runs much faster than us. (= She runs much faster than we do.) |
