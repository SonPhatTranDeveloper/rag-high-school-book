A GOAL Speculate about a Mystery

Vocabulary
A Read the text. Then, discuss your reaction to it with a partner.

The universe is huge. The number of stars in the universe is uncertain, but scientists think there may be as many as 400 billion in the part of the universe where Earth is located. Many of those stars may have planets, and many people believe that life may exist on at least some of them. So, some people wonder, "Where is everybody?" Many people have speculated about this mystery. They have come up with many theories to explain why we have not yet found any alien life. Here are three of them:

• One possibility is that life is very rare and that Earth is incredibly special; in other words, perhaps humans are alone in the universe.
• The universe is very ancient, so life could have existed on other worlds in the past but then died out before we could meet it.
• Another suggestion is that we do not have enough knowledge to recognize other life; aliens might have tried to contact us, but our technology was too basic to notice.

We have not discovered other life in our universe yet, but we continue to look for it. Perhaps we will get a message from another civilization soon. If that happens, there is no doubt it will have a very big impact on all of our lives.
