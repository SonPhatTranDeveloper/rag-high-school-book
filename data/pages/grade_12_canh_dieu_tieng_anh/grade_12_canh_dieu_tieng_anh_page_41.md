The Past Perfect

Use the past perfect to talk about something that happened before another event in the past.
subject + had + (not) + past participle

If the order in which things happened is clear or not important, either the past perfect or simple past can be used. Often, a word like before or after is added so the order is clear.

Local people discovered that hundreds of fruit bats had died because of the heat.

The bacteria had not been dangerous before the heat and humidity got worse.

The bacteria were not dangerous before the heat and humidity got worse.

C In pairs, underline examples of the past perfect in the text in A.

D Read each sentence and underline the event that happened first. Then rewrite the sentences in your notebook so the event is in the past perfect.

1. The Great Smog of 1952 made about 100,000 people sick before it ended.
2. After the smog ended, the government passed a law to clean up the air.
3. Approximately 200,000 antelope died because the weather became hotter.
4. Human populations decreased, so wild boars became a problem.
