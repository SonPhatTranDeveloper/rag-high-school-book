Lesson C
Adverbial Clauses of Comparison

Adverbial clauses of comparison indicate how the subject of the subordinate clause compares to the subject in the main clause.

Coaches should support female athletes as much as they support male athletes. The goalkeeper played better than the coach expected.

Female athletes can be as fast as male athletes. (= Female athletes can be as fast as male athletes are.)

Subordinating conjunctions used in adverbial clauses of comparison are usually "as" (to show equal comparisons) or "than" (to show comparatives). The verb in the clause is usually reduced. We can use an object pronoun instead.

The race took longer than expected. (= The race took longer than it had been expected.)

Lesson A
Double Comparatives

Double comparatives include two comparative adjectives in a sentence. The structure is The + comparative 1 + subject + verb, the + comparative 2 + subject + verb.

The higher the building is, the more frightened I feel.
The more I focus on my fear of germs, the dirtier everything seems.

Double comparatives show a cause-effect relationship between two things or events.

The worse the experience is (cause), the stronger the phobia can be (effect).
