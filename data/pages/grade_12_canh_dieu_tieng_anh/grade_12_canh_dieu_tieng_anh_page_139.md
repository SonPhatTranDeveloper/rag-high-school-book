Many people think they need a good education to get a good job. For these people, education is a serious matter. However, experts say that learning can, and should, be fun.

Gamification is one way to make learning more enjoyable. The name may be unfamiliar, but the idea is easy to understand. One common definition is that gamification is using ideas from games to make non-game situations more fun and enjoyable.

Gamification has many benefits. For example, students tend to enjoy studying more when their lessons are gamified. Gamification may also help learners concentrate for longer periods and feel more motivation to study. These can build students' confidence and improve their academic results.

Gamification also brings benefits outside of the classroom. A famous example happened in Stockholm, Sweden about ten years ago. Odenplan subway station turned stairs into a piano. People enjoyed music while walking, reducing escalator use by 66 percent.

In countries around the world, some schools also have a play-based curriculum. The idea is that informal play is better for young children than formal training. The country that is the best example of this is Finland. Children there do not start formal school until they are seven. Instead of learning to read or do math, younger children spend their time playing creative games.

Doctors are finding that play has benefits for adults, too. Some people who experience a dangerous situation may develop PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). People with PTSD may feel very worried about life. Playing video games can help people manage PTSD and improve their lives.

To sum up, games are more than just fun. Famous educators like Maria Montessori have suggested that play is the "work" children should do. Given its many benefits, perhaps adults also should work hard at play.
