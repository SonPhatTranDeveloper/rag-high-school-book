# GOAL: Discuss Pollution

## Vocabulary

A. Read the text. Does your town or city have a pollution problem? Discuss in pairs.

In early December 1952, the weather in London was very cold. In their houses, people lit fires to stay warm. On the streets, they took cars, buses, or trains to work. There was little wind, so the cold air stayed over the city. Pollution from the fires and vehicles also stayed in the air. When people woke up on the morning of December 5th, they saw thick fog.

Londoners had experienced thick fogs for hundreds of years. These thick fogs were called pea-soupers because their color was like soup made from yellow peas. But the Great Smog of 1952 was the worst one ever. It was so thick and so dark that drivers could not see the lights of other cars, people walked into each other on the streets, and nobody could see the sun.

By Tuesday, December 9th, the fog was gone, but its effects continued. The air quality had been so bad that thousands of people died and about 100,000 became sick. Luckily, not all of the effects were negative. Soon after the Great Smog, the government created the Clean Air Act. This law helped people breathe easier by reducing the level of pollution across the country.

Tower Bridge, a famous landmark in London, UK, is barely visible through the fog on the River Thames.
