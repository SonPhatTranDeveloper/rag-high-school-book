# Quality of Life

1. Each year, several organizations publish a list of world cities with the best quality of life. The organizations look at various factors to make their lists: a stable government, little crime, and good public transportation and hospitals. Cities with a good quality of life are also usually close to nature, have attractive buildings, access to museums, nice weather, and a clean environment.

2. For residents of these cities, life is generally great. However, even the best cities have some issues. In addition, approximately half of the world's population lives in cities with a lower quality of life. These people may dream of migrating somewhere better, but this may not be possible. A more practical alternative is for these people to find a way to improve the quality of life in their own communities.

3. Erik Ahlström provides a good example of this kind of personal action. Several years ago, he moved to Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. In general, Stockholm has an excellent quality of life. However, Ahlström felt that there was too much trash on the city streets. He decided to combine picking up the trash with jogging. He called this new activity plogging, and soon other people were helping him. However, it has become so popular that people now go plogging in communities all over the world.

4. Mary Clear and Pam Warhurst are also good examples. They live in Todmorden, a small town in northern England. They found some areas of land nobody was using and began growing vegetables, fruit, and herbs. Their idea was that local residents could pick and eat them. People from other places soon heard about this "incredible edible" idea and wanted to know more. Todmorden now has so many visitors that residents there joke that they have invented a new form of tourism called vegetable tourism.
