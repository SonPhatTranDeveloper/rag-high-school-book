UNIT 2

Lesson C

Adverbial Clauses of Result
Use so ... (that) + a clause to explain and give the result of something. The word(s) after so gives the reason, and the clause after that gives the result. (Note: that is optional.) Several so ... that patterns are possible:
1. so + adjective phrase (+ that) + clause
2. so + adverb phrase (+ that) + clause
3. so + many / few + countable noun phrase (+ that) + clause
4. so + much / little + uncountable noun phrase (+ that) + clause

Sometimes such (+ a / an) + (adjective) + noun (+ that) + clause can be used instead of so ... that to express the result.
1. The movie is so good that I've seen it three times. (It is such a good movie that I've seen it three times.)
2. She left so quickly that we couldn't say goodbye.
3. There are so many good jobs in this city that thousands of people have moved here. (There are such good jobs in this city that thousands of people have moved here.)
4. I have so little money this month that I cannot even take the bus to work.

C Rewrite each sentence pair into one sentence using so ... that and such ... that where possible.

1. He uses his phone often. The battery runs out very quickly. ______________________

2. She has lots of money. She can buy whatever she wants. ______________________

3. The cake was delicious. I ate all of it. Now I don't feel well! ______________________

4. The store had few customers. It had to close down. ______________________

5. Matt's idea was good. Everyone agreed with it immediately. ______________________

6. Jo answered the questions quickly. She was the first to finish. ______________________

Lesson A

Infinitives and -ing Forms 1
A few verbs can take either infinitives or -ing forms, but with a major difference in meaning.

For example, forget remember, stop, and try.

He stopped to buy chocolate.
(i.e., The reason he stopped was to buy chocolate.)

He stopped buying chocolate.
(i.e., He no longer buys chocolate.)

They didn't promise to call him.
(i.e., They didn't make any promise about calling.)

She doesn't like taking the bus each day.
(i.e., She has to take the bus, but she dislikes it.)

They promised not to call him.
(i.e., They promised that they would not call.)

She likes not taking the bus each day.
(i.e., She is happy that she doesn't take the bus.)

To say that an action didn't happen, use the correct form of does + not before the main verb.

It is also possible to make a negative sentence by putting the word not between to and the base verb (for infinitives) or before the -ing form.

For questions, use regular question word order.

Did he manage to finish all his work?
Why do you hate using the telephone?

A Circle the correct form (infinitive or -ing) to complete each sentence.

1. He forgot to buy / buying orange juice, so he has to go back to the store.

2. We stopped to shop / shopping at that store because of its high prices.

3. I promised to finish / finishing all of the work on time, but I couldn't do it.

4. She remembered to visit / visiting the same place when she was a child.

B Rewrite each sentence as a negative sentence and then again as a question.

1. The children enjoyed listening to their teacher tell them a story.
