A Read the text. In pairs, discuss what "great art" means to you.

In general, artists are creative people who want their work to have an effect on those who see it. Great art can definitely inspire positive feelings. However, people's ideas about what "great art" is can change over time. For example, Impressionist art is now widely considered to be great. However, it was controversial for many years. People said that the style of painting and the use of color were too different from traditional art.

Modern art can be controversial, too. Take Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans. As the name suggests, it was 32 pictures of cans of soup. When it went on display at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962, some experts liked it, but many people said that it was not art. Carl Andre created another controversial piece of art: Equivalent VIII is an installation that is just a pile of bricks. The Tate, a famous gallery in London, England, bought the unique work in 1976. It was not expensive, but public reaction to the exhibition was negative. People expected to see portraits on the wall, not bricks on the floor. How will people feel about Campbell's Soup Cans and Equivalent VIII in the future? Will people think they are works of genius, or will their opinion be less positive? Only time will tell.

Berthe Morisot (1841-1895), a French painter, was part of the Impressionist movement. This is one of her well-known pieces, called A Woman Seated at a Bench on the Avenue du Bois.
