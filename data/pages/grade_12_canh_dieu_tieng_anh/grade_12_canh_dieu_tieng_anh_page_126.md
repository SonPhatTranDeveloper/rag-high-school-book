Back to the Moon?

On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 rocket was launched into space. Sitting inside were Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. After a journey of around 238,855 miles and almost 110 hours, Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to step onto the moon. Over the next three years and five months, five more rockets traveled to the moon, and another 10 men stood on its surface. Or at least, this is what most people think.

Some people, however, believe that all of the evidence for the moon landings is fake. Research suggests that up to one quarter of people in some countries think that humans have never visited the moon.

These people say pictures and videos from the moon's surface show flags moving in the wind, but there is no wind on the moon. They also say that the pictures show no stars in the sky, so they could not have been taken by astronauts.
