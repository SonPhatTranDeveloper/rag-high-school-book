# Is Coffee in Danger?

Around the world, coffee is grown by about 25 million farmworkers on about 27 million acres of land. That's more than seven percent of Earth's surface! Just in Brazil, the world's largest coffee grower, almost 6.2 billion pounds of coffee are grown each year. In the United States, coffee exports reached approximately 1.78 million tonnes in 2022 alone. Every year, people drink more than 500 billion cups. Businesses in the United States spend about $5.5 billion to bring coffee into the country, and make more than $12 billion by selling it. Coffee is big business.

Unfortunately, climate change could be a big threat to this business and the people who depend on it. To grow good coffee, the weather must be just right. If it is too hot or too cold, or if there is too much or too little rain, the plants might die or the coffee beans might be of poor quality. Climate change is making the world hotter and changing where and how much rain falls. Many regions that have perfect weather for growing coffee now will not be good places to grow coffee in the future. In Brazil, for example, more than half of good coffee land will not be usable by the year 2050.

Even worse, an insect called the coffee berry borer beetle, which likes to eat coffee beans, also loves hotter weather. This means that as the climate changes, there will be more of these insects living in more places and more coffee plants will be attacked. In addition, diseases such as coffee rust (a disease that causes the tree to lose its ability to produce berries/beans) become more common when the weather is hotter and wetter.

Coffee is the favorite drink of people all over the world. Unless humans work together to stop climate change and protect coffee, it could become part of our history, not our future.

Farmworkers who depend on coffee for their livelihoods are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
