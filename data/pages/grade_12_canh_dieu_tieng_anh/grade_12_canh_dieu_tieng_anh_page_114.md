GOAL CHECK

Choose one of the sets of questions below. Discuss in groups.

1. What is a healthy diet or lifestyle? Do you think it's a risk to follow a strict diet or lifestyle for a long time? Which can be harmful if they are done too much?

2. Think of five dangerous activities that could benefit children (or adults). Why might doing them bring benefits? Which of the activities have you done? Which would you do?

Is Too Much Safety a Risk?

For most people, life today is safer than it was 1,000, 100, or even 10 years ago. However, most parents still spend time and money keeping their children as safe as possible. They buy them helmets to wear when riding a bike. They keep them away from things that could cause injury. These actions seem good, but some people argue that too much safety may actually be bad.

These people say that children cannot learn how to stay safe if they are never in dangerous situations. Moreover, children learn while doing dangerous things. For example, they learn to take responsibility for themselves and their actions.
