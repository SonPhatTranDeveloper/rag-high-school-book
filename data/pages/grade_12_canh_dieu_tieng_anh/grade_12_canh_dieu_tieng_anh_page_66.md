A Birthday to Remember

On the morning of June 23rd, 2018, Peerapai Sompiangjai, whose nickname is "Night," was excited. It was his seventeenth birthday, and his plans were to practice soccer and then have fun with his team, the Wild Boars.

To celebrate Night's birthday, the Wild Boars explored the Tham Luang Cave in northern Thailand. Their coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, went with them. Usually it is safe to explore the cave in June, but heavy summer rains suddenly came down. The cave began filling with water and they were trapped!

When the boys did not come home that evening, their parents became worried. They found the boys' bicycles, bags, and shoes outside the cave and raised the alarm. Soon, the story became big news around the world. Volunteers from many countries traveled to Thailand to help.

Inside the cave, the situation was not good. They had a little water, but almost no food. Coach Chantawong tried to help the boys. He let them eat his share of the food. He also told them to lie still in order to use less oxygen.

At last, on July 2nd, three divers found the team alive. Now that divers knew the boys' location, they could bring food, oxygen, and medicine to them. However, the cave was full of water, the boys could not swim, and they were far from the cave entrance.

The rescuers came up with a dangerous, desperate plan. First, they put diving equipment on the boys, then tied themselves to the boys and helped them swim to a dry part of the cave. Finally, more than 100 helpers took turns carrying the boys out of the cave.
