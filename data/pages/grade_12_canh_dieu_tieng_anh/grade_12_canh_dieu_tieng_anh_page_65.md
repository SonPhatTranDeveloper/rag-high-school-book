Grammar (See Grammar Reference p. 151)

The Simple Past vs. The Past Continuous

Use the simple past to describe a completed action or event in the past.
In the context of natural disasters, we use the simple past to describe the impact or results of the event.

The earthquake destroyed many buildings in the city.
The avalanche buried the town under the snow, and most houses were damaged.

Use the past continuous to describe an ongoing action or event in the past, often with a sense of duration or background information.
In the context of natural disasters, we use the past continuous to set the scene or provide a context for the main event.

The river was flooding and the water was rising rapidly when the storm hit.

Conversation

In pairs, write the correct verb form in each blank. Then, listen to check your answers.

Eric: Did you feel that earthquake last night?
Tom: Yeah, I felt it. I (1) __________ (sleep) when the ground (2) __________ (start) shaking. I was worried that the roof might collapse.
Mel: I (3) __________ (be) awake when it (4) __________ (happen). I (5) __________ (watch) TV and suddenly the lamps (6) __________ (start) swaying. I knew it was an earthquake right away.
Tom: I hate earthquakes. I've experienced a few before and they're always scary.
Mel: Yeah, but it's important to know what to do in those situations. You should stay inside and protect yourself until it's over.
Eric: That's true.

Practice the conversation in groups of three. Then, talk about disasters you have heard about.

GOAL CHECK Talk about Threats to Survival

In groups, complete the tasks and discuss the questions.

1. Share your lists of threats from C. How many natural disasters are on your lists?
2. In the conversation, Eric, Tom, and Mel talk about earthquake and how to stay safe during such an event. Based on this information, make a list of safety tips for other natural disasters. Share your list with the class.

SPEAKING STRATEGY
Use while or when to connect a clause in the Simple Past and a clause in the Past Continuous. The Past Continuous is more likely to go with while.
