COMMUNICATION SKILLS: Making Recommendations or Suggestions

When you discuss a problem, you may want to recommend or suggest an action or a solution. You can use various expressions to introduce your recommendations and suggestions:

My recommendation is to... / Why not... ? / If I were in your shoes, I would...

In general, it is a good idea to support your suggestions with one or more reasons or benefits. These can be general comments, things you have read or heard, or even personal experiences. You may also wish to mention how somebody can get more information about your suggestion.

Read the information in the box. Then, reread the email from C and answer the questions in pairs.

1. In the email, which three expressions does Tommy use to introduce his recommendations?

2. How does Tommy support his first suggestion? Does he use a general comment or a personal experience?

3. How does Tommy support both his second and third recommendations?

4. For which suggestion does Tommy explain how to get more information?

Writing

Choose a common problem in career choices. It can be one of the problems in A or another problem, such as lacking guidance or not making your own decisions. Imagine that one of your English-speaking friends is having this problem. Write some suggestions (150-180 words) for how he or she could deal with this problem. Use the email in C as a model.

In pairs, share your ideas from E. Give each other feedback. Then, work together to have more solutions to the problem.

GOAL CHECK Describe Problems and Solutions

Complete these steps.

1. Present your ideas from E and F to the class, using notes rather than reading your writing aloud.

2. In groups, discuss which were the best suggestions you heard, and why.

3. In different groups, discuss some other problems that you or your friends often have and talk about possible solutions to them.
