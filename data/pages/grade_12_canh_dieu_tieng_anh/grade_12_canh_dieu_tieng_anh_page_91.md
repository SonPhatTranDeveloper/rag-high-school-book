Virtual reality headsets allow users to feel as if they are truly present in the environment.

However, visiting tourist sites and eating out is not cheap. Some people overcome this problem by choosing to be "armchair travelers." They take a staycation, read books, or watch documentaries about other places. The cost is very low. Still, reading or watching a show about a place is a poor alternative to going there.

Virtual reality may offer a high-tech way to "see" the world. A "traveler" puts on a VR headset and the software takes her on a "journey" to another place. The VR traveler feels she is really in that place. VR travel is not a perfect solution, either. Studies show that having real experiences is important for our happiness. Still, the technology will get better. Perhaps in the near future, VR will give us the chance to "explore" the moon or Mars.
