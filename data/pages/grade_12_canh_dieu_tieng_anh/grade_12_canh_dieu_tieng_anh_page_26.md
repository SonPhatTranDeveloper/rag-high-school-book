# GOAL: Discuss Mental Influences

## Listening

A. Look at the girls in the photo. What similarities and differences do you think they have? For example, do you think one might be more polite or outgoing than the other? Discuss in a group.

B. Read these situations in pairs. Discuss what you think about each person's actions, and what you might say to him or her.

- You are at a park. A young boy is crying. A woman sitting next to the boy is looking at her phone instead of taking care of him.

- You are at a drugstore. You have been waiting to pay for a long time. Suddenly, a man runs to the front of the line. He buys one thing and leaves the store without saying sorry to anyone.

C. Listen to an interview and take notes. Then, choose the right answers.

1. What do the speakers say about cognitive biases?
