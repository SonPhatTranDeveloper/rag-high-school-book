A Read the text. Then, in small groups, discuss which stage of life is most interesting for a child and why.

Humans go through many physical changes from childhood to adulthood. For example, a baby boy might weigh 2.7 kg and be less than 0.5 m at birth, but might grow to 120 kg and 2 m tall by the age of 20. In addition, people go through many mental changes. In fact, in some ways, the development of our minds is greater and more important than the growth of our bodies.

Here are some important cognitive milestones that all children go through:

0 to 11 months:
- Can make out the faces of family members
- Can respond to facial expressions like smiles
- Begin to connect words to objects or pictures

1 to 3 years:
- Can act on instructions from adults or caregivers
- Can imagine and make up stories or play imaginary games
- May begin to tell lies about things they did or did not do

4 to 8 years:
- Can make out basic emotions like happiness in other people
- May find that the actions of their friends can affect them
- Can stand up to challenges and use more than one method to solve problems or puzzles

9 to 12 years:
- May like to set a physical or mental challenge for themselves
- Can understand that their actions may have long-term effects

13 to 17 years:
- Can pick up on most emotions, such as disgust or shock, in others
- Can understand and influence the beliefs of other people

Teenagers (ages 13-19) tend to take more risks than people of other ages.
