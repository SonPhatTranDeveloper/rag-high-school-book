# GOAL: Produce a Biographical Profile

## Communication

A. In groups, make a list of the five most famous artists you know. Then discuss these questions.

1. How many of your listed artists are men? Does this number surprise you? Why?
2. How many of the artists are still alive? Does this number surprise you? Why?
3. Where do the artists come from? Are people from some countries better at art than people from other countries? Why do you think so?

B. In different groups, say which of these three works of art you like most, and why. Then, read the three profiles and discuss which artist probably painted each work.

[Three paintings labeled A, B, and C]

1. Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun was born in France in 1755 and died in 1842. She had so much talent that she made money from painting when she was still a teenager. In fact, although many great portrait artists lived during this period, she was very successful. Vigée Le Brun is most famous for her portraits of famous women, such as Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France.

2. Ōi Katsushika was born around 1800 and died about 66 years later. Her father was Hokusai, one of the most famous of all Japanese artists. Like him, she was a gifted artist who painted works in a style called ukiyo-e. She was famously good at painting women, but also painted scenes of nature and daily life in Japan.

3. Mary Cassatt was born in the US in 1844. She wanted to become an artist, so she moved to France when she was 22. She lived most of the rest of her life there until her death in 1926. While there, Cassatt met and was influenced by Impressionist artists like Edgar Degas and Claude Monet. She began to paint portraits and natural scenes in the Impressionist style.
