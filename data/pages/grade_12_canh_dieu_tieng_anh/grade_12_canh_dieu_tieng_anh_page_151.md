3. In general, innovative people want to learn. They actively learn through reading, discussions, and exploring new places. They have new experiences. These enable them to make unique connections between ideas and generate new ones.

4. Asking questions is another habit that many innovative people have. They habitually ask questions to understand how things work, why things happen, and how to improve processes. These questions help them find solutions to problems.

5. Innovative people usually come up with many ideas, often leading to some being forgotten. To avoid this, innovators often have a way to remember their best ideas. While some may use computers or tablets, many innovators prefer old technology: a notebook and a pencil.

6. While "If it's not broken, don't fix it" is a common saying, many innovators constantly seek ways to improve things, even things that are already good. In other words, "Even if it's not broken, make it better" is an innovator's saying.

7. Finally, innovators spend hours finding new ways to do things. Some follow the "Don't break the chain" idea, setting daily goals and marking an X on the calendar after completing them. Seeing the chain of Xs gives them a positive feeling. And in order to keep that positive feeling, they do the action each day.

Successful innovators often possess certain daily habits that contribute to their ability to generate new ideas.
