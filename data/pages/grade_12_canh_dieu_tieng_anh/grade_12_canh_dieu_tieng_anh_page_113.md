Adverbials of Time

Adverbials are clauses or phrases that give more information about the main verb of a sentence. Adverbials of time explain when something happened.

Greg broke his leg as he was playing football.
She sprained her knee just before the race.

Clauses include a time conjunction like while or when plus a subject and verb.

When she fell over, the girl bruised her leg.

Phrases include a time preposition like after or before and an object instead of a subject and verb.

The boy cried after scraping his knee.

Use a comma after a time adverbial when it comes before the main clause.

As soon as he burned his leg, he called 911.
He called 911 as soon as he burned his leg.

3. Deliver your talk in front of the class. Make sure each person in your group speaks.

4. Discuss which injury was the most common in the class. Also discuss which advice for avoiding and treating injuries was the most useful.

"Me, too. It was so painful!"

"I haven't burned my hand, but I burned my leg once."
