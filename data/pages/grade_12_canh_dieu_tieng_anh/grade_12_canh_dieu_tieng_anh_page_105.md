C. Read the compare and contrast text. In pairs, discuss how it is organized: by point or by subject. Then, work together to rewrite the piece using the other kind of organization.

Doing Team Sports or Individual Sports

Playing sports is often a good way to make friends. People who play team sports can become good friends with the other players on their team. For example, they can become friendly when they practice or play games, or if they go out together after practice. In contrast, people who play individual sports have fewer opportunities to make friends because they play alone.

Playing sports is also a good way to become fit and healthy. For most team sports, players need to run, jump, throw or hit a ball, and so on. These kinds of activities are good for people's bodies. In terms of health and fitness, individual sports are about the same as team sports. Players usually do the same things: running, jumping, and throwing or hitting a ball.

In conclusion, both team sports and individual sports have good points. On the whole, though, I think team sports are the better option for most people because of the social benefits they offer.
