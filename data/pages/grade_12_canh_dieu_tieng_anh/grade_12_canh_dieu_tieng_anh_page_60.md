# A GOAL Say How Things Could Be Different

## Vocabulary

A Read the text. Then, discuss the meaning of the blue words with a partner.

One scientific study suggests that up to two billion different species may be alive now. That's a big number. However, since life began on Earth, scientists think at least five billion kinds of plants and animals have gone extinct. They know this from the discovery of many unknown kinds of fossils: dead plants or animals that have turned to stone.

Why did so many species not survive? Some species died out slowly because conditions changed. Others were killed in a huge natural disaster that happened about 66 million years ago. A big rock from space, called a comet, hit Earth. It killed the dinosaurs and caused terrible conditions. If humans had been alive at that time, they would have felt terror.

Many species are dying out these days, so some scientists think another mass extinction is happening now. They see a relationship between human activity and these deaths. For example, they think the problem is happening because humans are causing climate change. Is there any way to rescue species that are in danger? Maybe. If a scientist found a way to stop climate change, he or she would be a hero to people who care about the planet.
