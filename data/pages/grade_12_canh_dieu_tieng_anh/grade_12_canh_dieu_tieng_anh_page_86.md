# GOAL: Discuss Transportation Choices

A Read the information. In pairs, discuss which benefits of self-driving cars you have heard before. Also say which two benefits are most important to you and why.

Many experts think self-driving vehicles (SDVs) will soon be a common sight on our roads. They feel this is likely because SDVs have many benefits over normal vehicles:

- air quality - SDVs drive more efficiently, so they create less pollution.
- open cities - SDVs can park in small spaces, so parking lots could become real parks.
- personal time - SDV passengers do not drive, so they can spend travel time as they like.
- safety - Machines make fewer errors than people, so more SDVs will mean fewer accidents.
- travel cost - Private vehicles cost a lot; SDVs may allow people to share the cost of a vehicle.
