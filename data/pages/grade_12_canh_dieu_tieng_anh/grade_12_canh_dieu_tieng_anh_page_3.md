TIENG ANH 12
EXPLORE NEW WORLDS

This appears to be the cover of an English textbook for Vietnamese students. The main title "TIENG ANH 12" is in Vietnamese, which translates to "English 12" in English. The subtitle "EXPLORE NEW WORLDS" is in English.

The book is labeled as a student's book ("SÁCH HỌC SINH") and appears to be a sample version ("BẢN MẪU").

At the bottom of the cover, there are two logos:
1. A logo for VEPIC, which seems to be a Vietnamese educational publishing company.
2. The National Geographic Learning logo.

The cover also features multiple signatures, presumably of the authors or contributors to the textbook.

This textbook appears to be designed for 12th grade Vietnamese students learning English, with a focus on exploring new worlds through language learning. The involvement of National Geographic Learning suggests the content may incorporate global and cultural elements in the English language instruction.
