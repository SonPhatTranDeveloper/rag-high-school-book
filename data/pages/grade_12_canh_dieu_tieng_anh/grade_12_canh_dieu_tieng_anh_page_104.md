## Writing

### WRITING SKILLS: Comparing and Contrasting

One common type of writing task is to compare and contrast two subjects, such as the benefits of doing team sports or individual sports. You can organize this type of writing in two ways.

| Organize by Point | Organize by Subject |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| You need two or three paragraphs—one for each point you will focus on. Each paragraph: | You need two paragraphs—one for each of the subjects you are comparing. Each paragraph explains how a few points (usually no more than three) relate to one of your two subjects. |
| • explains how one point relates to subject one. | |
| • explains how this the same point relates to subject two. | |

### Conclusion
In a separate, final paragraph, you need to add a conclusion that states which of the two subjects you think is better.
