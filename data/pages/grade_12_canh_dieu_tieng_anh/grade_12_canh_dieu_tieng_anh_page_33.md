WRITING SKILLS: Answering Unasked Questions

Good communicators think about questions their readers or listeners might have about the topic and then answer those questions when they speak or write. Some examples of unasked questions that you could answer include:

Why? Who? Where? When? What? How? How much? How many? How long? How often?

Read this paragraph about an emotional experience. Then work in pairs to match each underlined phrase to the unasked question that it answers.

I once experienced mixed feelings on my birthday two years ago. I got up in the morning, expecting my family and friends to do something special, but they did not give me any gifts or even say "Happy birthday!" This made me feel very sad and disappointed, of course. In the evening, I texted some friends to see if they wanted to go out, but they all said they were too busy and refused to join me. This made me kind of angry. Then, somebody knocked on my door. When I opened it, my family and all of my friends were standing there, with a birthday cake and my name on it! They even sang the "Happy birthday" song for me! They had come to have a party at my home. I was very surprised, but also really happy that people had not forgotten my birthday. In fact, it was an unforgettable moment in my life.

Work individually. Plan and then write one paragraph (180-200 words) about a time when you experienced one or more emotions. Make sure you answer some unasked questions your readers might have. Use the paragraph in C as a guide.

GOAL CHECK Describe an Emotional Experience

Talk about a positive emotional experience you had recently. Say:

• what the experience was.
• where and when you had it.
• who was with you when you had it.
• and how it made you feel.

Take one minute to prepare, and then speak for 1-2 minutes.
