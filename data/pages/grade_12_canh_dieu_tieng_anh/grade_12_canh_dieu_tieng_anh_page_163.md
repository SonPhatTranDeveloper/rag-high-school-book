UNIT 10

Lesson C
Adverbials of Time

The time expressions in time adverbials are often conjunctions like after, as, before, since, until, when, or while. In most cases, conjunctions are followed by a subject and verb.

It happened after the meeting took place.
She has worked here since she was twenty.
We will stay until you have finished it.
I was happy when I was living in that city.

1. Sometimes, the time adverbial can be reduced after a conjunction.
2. In reduced adverbials, the subject is dropped and the verb is turned into an -ing form.

1. They talked about it before they met him.
→They talked about it before meeting him.

2. We left the office after we finished the work.
→ We left the office after finishing the work.

The time expressions in time adverbials can also be prepositions like after, before, during, since, or until. Use a noun or noun phrase, not a subject and verb, after a preposition.

It happened after the meeting.
She has worked here since 2011.
We will stay until the end of the work day.
I was happy during my time in that city.

Lesson A
Modals to Discuss the Past

To talk about something that definitely (or almost definitely) did not happen in the past, use can't / cannot + have + past participle.

This statue looks old, but it can't have come from ancient Rome because it was made just 20 years ago.

Modals that can be used to talk about what must, might, or can't have happened are called modals of deduction.

A Complete each sentence with can't, might, or must.

1. Jon __________ have bought a new car because he doesn't have any money right now.
2. I can't find my phone. I __________ have left it on the train or perhaps I left it at home.
3. She __________ have called earlier, but I haven't checked my messages, so I'm not sure.
4. Joe __________ have been really disappointed when he learned that he had lost his job.
5. Su doesn't have a passport, so she __________ have taken a vacation in another country.

B Replace the modal in each sentence in A with the modals in parentheses. Change the rest of the sentence, too, so that it makes sense.

1. (could) ________________________________________
2. (must) ________________________________________
3. (can't) ________________________________________
4. (may) _________________________________________
5. (must) ________________________________________

Lesson C
Noun Clauses

Noun clauses do not express a complete idea, so they cannot act as a complete sentence.

What he should do: He did not know what he should do.

The following words often begin noun clauses:
how, that, what(ever), when(ever), where(ver), whether, which(ever), who(m)(ever), why

We can go there on whichever day you want.
Whether his plan will work or not is a mystery.
Her strength is that she always works hard.
