Reported Speech

One way to report what somebody said is to quote his or her words. This is called direct speech.

"I'm going to the gallery tomorrow," Sarah said.
Paulo said, "I'll go in a few weeks."
Maria told Jorge, "Hang this picture next to the window."
"Don't mix the colors too soon," our art teacher said.

Indirect speech is another way to report a person's words. Some common reporting verbs are ask, order, request, and warn. Note the following changes in indirect speech:
• Verb form (The form usually changes—for example, from present to past—to make it clear that the person spoke at an earlier time.)
• Pronouns
• Time expressions (yesterday → the previous day, tomorrow → the next day, next week → the following week...)
• Command, orders, requests, and instructions can be reported with told somebody (not) to do something.

Sarah said (that) she was going to the gallery the next day.
Paulo said (that) he would go a few weeks later.
Maria told Jorge to hang that picture next to the window.
Our art teacher warned us not to mix the colors too soon.
