Adverbial Clauses of Manner

The way / like / as if / as though are conjunctions. We use them with other verbs to say how somebody does something.

Like / the way

As if / as though

Use unreal tenses (subjunctive) to describe an imaginary situation:
He walks as if he knew the place.
(He gives the impression that he knows the place, but he doesn't.)

Use real tenses to describe a real situation:
He walks as if he knows the place.
(Perhaps he actually knows the place.)

GOAL CHECK Talk about Personal Characteristics

Make three lists of words to describe the characteristics you want in a close friend, a teacher, and a manager. Then, complete these steps.

1. In pairs, take turns sharing the words from one of your lists, but don't say which list it is. Can your partner guess which person you are describing?

2. Repeat step 1 twice more, with a different partner each time, until you have shared all three lists.
