To find out about the things that people value most in life, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) surveyed people in many countries. The OECD's questions asked people to give a score for several criteria, or topics, based on how good they felt about these parts of their lives. The average score for all topics is the overall level of life satisfaction in that country. The criteria were: having access to high-quality education; being able to find a balance between work and other parts of life; having good opportunities for a successful career; making a good income and having enough wealth; being able to afford a nice home; feeling safe; having good health and access to high-quality medical care; and living in a clean environment.
