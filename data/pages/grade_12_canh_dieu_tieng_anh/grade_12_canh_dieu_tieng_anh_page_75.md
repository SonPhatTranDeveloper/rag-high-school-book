PRONUNCIATION: Thought Groups

When speaking, people usually divide their words into "thought groups" that express a single idea. In general:
• thought groups have a "focus word" that is given extra emphasis. This focus word can be a noun, an adjective, or a verb.
• speakers pause slightly at the end of each thought group, not in the middle.
• speakers often use falling intonation on the last word of each thought group.
• articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and auxiliary verbs are normally not stressed.

She said // that the art gallery // was amazing.

F 28 Say each sentence aloud, pausing at the // and paying attention to the focus words and intonation. Then listen and check your answers.

1. As far as I'm concerned, // it's a waste of money.

2. Real art is portraits // painted by geniuses // on display in galleries.

3. I think public art is important // because it adds character // to the city.

4. So, // from my perspective, // we need more public art, // not less.

G 29 In pairs, discuss and mark the thought groups, focus words, and intonation in these sentences. Then, listen and check your answers.

Well, first, I'm sure the ball pit is going to bring a lot of tourists into the city. Those tourists will spend money, so the project will actually boost the economy. Also, I think the ball pit will make people in the city smile. And with so much bad news these days, we all need more fun, more laughter, don't you think?
