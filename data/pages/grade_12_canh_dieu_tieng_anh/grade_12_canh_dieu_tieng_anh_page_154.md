UNIT 1
Lesson A

Present Perfect Tenses

The present perfect (has / have + past participle) and continuous (has / have + been + present participle) both refer to past situations connected to the present.

I have lived here for a long time.
I've been living here for a long time.

Form the present perfect as follows:
subject + has / 's / have / 've (+ not) + past participle (+ object)

He's lived there.
He hasn't lived there.

Form questions as follows:
Has (n't) / Have (n't) + subject + past participle (+ object) + ?

Has he lived there?
Hasn't he lived there?

Form the present perfect continuous as follows:
subject + has / 's / have / 've + (not) been + present participle (+ object)

He's been living there.
He hasn't been living there.

Form questions as follows:
Has (n't) / Have (n't) + subject + been + present participle (+ object) + ?

Has he been living there?
Hasn't he been living there?

In most cases, use the present perfect:
1. to emphasize that an event has been completed.
2. with verbs that take no time to complete.
3. to emphasize that an action will not be repeated.
4. for things that have been true for a very long time.
5. with stative verbs connected to our minds or senses.

1. He has told us already.
2. She's just started a new job.
3. You've given us some great news!
4. People have lived in this city for thousands of years.
5. You've known me since I was a kid.

In most cases, use the present perfect continuous:
1. to emphasize how long something continued.
2. to describe past actions that are still continuing.

1. They've been waiting for hours.
2. It has been raining since yesterday.

Some time expressions are common with both tenses:
1. Use for to say how long something has continued.
2. Use since to indicate when something started.
3. Use during / for / in the last + period to say how long or how often.
4. Use recently or lately to discuss recent events or actions.
5. Use ever or never to talk or ask about things you have done or not done in your life.

1. We've worked together for years.
2. We've been working together since we finished college.
3. I've been there three times in the last 10 years.
4. She's been calling me a lot recently.
5. I've never visited Japan or Korea.
