Relative Clauses (Adjective Clauses): Defining and Non-defining

Relative clauses (also called adjective clauses) come after a noun and give additional information about it. The architect who / that created the building just won an award.

Sometimes a relative clause gives extra information that is necessary in order to understand which person or thing the sentence refers to. These clauses are written without commas. The artist who / that sculpted this is from Mexico. I love the illustration that / which is on page 27.

Sometimes a relative clause gives extra information that is unnecessary because it is clear which person or thing the sentence refers to (even without the clause). These clauses are written with commas. This gallery, which opened last year, has a great display of ceramic art. My sister, who is two years older than me, is a furniture designer.

Sometimes a relative clause gives information (usually comments or opinions) about the whole clause preceding it. These clauses are written at the end of the sentences with commas, and starting with which. He paid $5,000 for the portrait, which surprised everyone in the room. The City Council has approved a new location for our museum, which is the right decision to make.

Complete these sentences by writing who, which, or that in the correct spaces. Then, compare answers in pairs.

• Use (1) __________ (or (2) __________) to introduce a relative clause that gives more information about a person.
• Use (3) __________ (or (4) __________) to introduce a relative clause which gives more information about a thing.
• Use only (5) __________ or (6) __________ in relative clauses that give additional, unnecessary information, not (7) __________.
• Use (8) __________, not (9) __________ in relative clauses that give comments or opinions about the whole clauses before them.

Conversation

In pairs, decide if you need who, which, or that in each blank. Then listen to check your answers.

Ella: My friend Ben, __________ works at the art gallery, told me about some new controversial art. Do you want to go see it?
Hiro: Controversial art? Like what?
Ella: Well, there's a work called Equivalent VIII, __________ is just a pile of bricks on the floor, by American artist Carl Andre. And Ben said that Campbell's Soup Cans, __________ I really want to see, is on display, too.
Hiro: What? Soup cans? Why are soup cans in a gallery?
Ella: No, I mean Campbell's Soup Cans by the artist Andy Warhol, __________ is American.
Hiro: Really? Cans don't sound much like art to me, but I'd like to see the exhibition!
