## C. In pairs, write a paragraph based on these notes. Use the paragraph in A as a model.

- some babies who are born early die → cannot stay warm
- some students who attended Stanford Univ → innovative solution
- created a special blanket → Embrace Care infant warmer
- blanket can be heated → electricity / hot water
- stays warm for hours → safer for babies
- Embrace products helped 1,000,000 early babies → cheap / easy-to-use

## Communication

### D. In groups, discuss these questions. Give reasons for your opinions.

1. Which is more innovative: Finland's baby boxes or Embrace Care infant warmers?
2. What emotions would new parents who get the baby box or the Embrace Care blanket feel?
3. What other solutions to its problem could Finland have adopted?
4. What other solutions to keeping babies warm can you come up with?

### E. In pairs, read the situation and discuss a solution. Then present your solution to the class. Use expressions of purpose, reason, and result.

> In most countries in the world, women spend much more time looking after young babies than men do. This is not fair. In order to improve the situation, your government wants to get men to spend more time looking after infants.
