PRONUNCIATION: Diphthongs

A diphthong is a sound made by combining two vowel sounds together in one syllable. There are eight diphthongs in English: /aɪ/ (light), /eɪ/ (race), /əʊ/ (spoke), /aʊ/ (hour), /ɪə/ (care), /ɪə/ (nearly), /ɔɪ/ (boy), /ʊə/ (sure). In English, diphthongs require a lot of tongue and lip movement, which can be hard if you are not used to it. One way to practice pronouncing diphthongs is by saying the first vowel sound and then sliding slowly to the second vowel sound.

Listen to some excerpts from the interview. Underline the words containing diphthongs and decide which diphthong each word contains. Then, write them in the chart below.

1. Excuse me? A fast time for a woman?

2. My time is good enough to go to the Olympic Games. Maybe even good enough to win a medal.

3. I've upset you, haven't I? That wasn't my intention. Sorry.

4. You've made some very interesting points, Grace.

[A chart with four columns labeled /eɪ/, /aɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /əʊ/ is shown for filling in words containing these diphthongs]

In pairs, take turns reading the extract in E aloud. Make sure you pronounce the diphthongs clearly.
