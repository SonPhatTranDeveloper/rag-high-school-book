# A GOAL Talk about How Long or How Often

## Vocabulary

### A Read the messages.

Hi Emily,
How are you? I hope you and your family are well. My wife and I have been talking about moving to your city. There are several factors, but the main reason is that we want a better quality of life. You've lived there for many years. Do you think it's a good place to live?
Pablo

Hi Pablo,
Lovely to hear from you, Pablo. I'm excited that you've been thinking of moving here. Like many residents, I think there are many great communities in the city. About half of the population comes from different cultures from around the world, so it's an exciting, multicultural place. It's not perfect, though. Most neighborhoods are nice, but some are dirty with a lot of trash on the streets. And these days, people are less friendly and don't try to help each other. I guess society has changed a lot since we were kids! Anyway, before you make a decision, read books on migration problems. I've read several, and they have some good advice.
