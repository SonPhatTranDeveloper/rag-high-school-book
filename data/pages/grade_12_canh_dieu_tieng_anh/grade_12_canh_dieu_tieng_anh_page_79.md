A "Sài Gòn sun suddenly cools off  
Since your dress is of Hà Đông silk  
I still love that dress's color  
The white silk still sings my verse..."(*)

Those beautiful lines are from a poem praising an item of national pride in Việt Nam— the áo dài. More specially, that áo dài is made from something else that brings pride to Việt Nam—silk.

B With its economy heavily reliant on agricultural practices, Việt Nam is home to a rich and diverse array of arts related to the animals and plants seen on its fertile soil. A peculiar combination of these two is silk weaving, where silk fibers from silkworms are woven into a special type of cloth. This cloth, in turn, enables the creation of such amazing outfits as the Vietnamese áo dài.

C Several thousand years ago, Việt people living in the Red River Delta found out that silkworms liked to eat mulberry leaves and then produced silk fibers to wrap themselves in cocoons. After boiling these cocoons, people —mainly women—used a spinning wheel to separate the silk threads from them. These threads would then be woven on a loom to make silk.

D Not only a lightweight and breathable material, silk also resists soil and odors well. However, what really makes it highly valuable is how silk looks and feels. Its luster, shine, smoothness, and coolness add luxury and elegance to any clothing items made from silk.

E Việt Nam has many famous silk-producing regions throughout the country, such as Hà Đông in the North, Duy Xuyên in Central, and Tân Châu in the South. From the artful hands of Vietnamese women in these regions comes the secret behind Việt Nam's áo dài—the silk whose mere look can cool wearers off even Sài Gòn's heat.
