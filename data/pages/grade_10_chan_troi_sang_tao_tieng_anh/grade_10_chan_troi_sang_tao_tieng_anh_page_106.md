20th-century inventions
The most important modern invention has to be the mobile phone. It was only invented in the 1970s, but look at it now! Everyone has a phone. Originally, of course, phones were large and were only used to make phone calls. Now those phones are in museums! Modern mobile phones are mini-computers - you can do so much with them. You can buy very expensive phones, but you can also buy cheap models. That's why, in my view, it's the best 20th-century invention.

2 What is the purpose of the text?
a to advertise mobile phones
b to invite people to a museum exhibition
c to give an opinion about an invention
d to advise people to avoid cheap phones

3D printers
3D printers are a new kind of machine that can make everyday objects. They're amazing because they can produce different things in different materials, from cups and plates to plastic toys and even chocolate cakes! So how do they work? First you design a 3D object on your computer, then you connect it to a 3D printer. Press 'print' and watch it work. The printer makes the object in very thin layers, like the pages of a book - one on top of the other until you have a complete object.

3 What is the writer of the text doing?
a giving an idea about the future of printers
b describing an invention
c giving a short history of an object
d explaining different inventions
