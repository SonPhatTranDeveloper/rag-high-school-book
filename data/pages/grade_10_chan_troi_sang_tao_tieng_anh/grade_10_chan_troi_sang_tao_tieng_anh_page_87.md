A special connection

Beth and her twin sister Harriet are convinced that they are able to share experiences and feelings without seeing or speaking to each other. Here's what Beth says:

"Last year I was on a walking holiday with Harriet. She told me that her right ankle was hurting, but she didn't know why. She said she hadn't twisted it or anything, but told me she couldn't put any weight on it. About a minute later, I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my right ankle! On another occasion, I told Harriet that I had watched a really good video clip on the internet the day before. I said that I would send her a link to the website where I'd found it. I told her she must watch it. Imagine my surprise when she said she had come across the same clip at the same time! She said that after she'd finished watching it, she had thought about sending me the link."
