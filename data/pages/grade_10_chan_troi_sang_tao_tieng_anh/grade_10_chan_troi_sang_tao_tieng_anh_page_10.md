[Image description: A classroom scene with students wearing virtual reality headsets and a teacher standing behind them.]

This is a classroom in a secondary school in Canada. The classroom is very high-tech. The students are looking at something through virtual 3D glasses. The man standing behind is a teacher. He's explaining something. Virtual glasses are quite new in classrooms in Canada. They allow the students to see three dimensional images. Mary, the student in the middle says, "The glasses are fun. They bring the lessons alive. We are learning about an earthquake in Ecuador, and seeing it in 3D makes you feel like you are there, not at school just watching it on TV."
