4C Listening

Eyewitness
I can identify the context of a dialogue or monologue.

1 [2.04] SPEAKING How observant are you? Look at the photo for 30 seconds and remember as much detail as you can. Then listen to the description. What mistakes do you notice in the description?

[Image description: A photograph shows two people standing in the doorway of a hair salon during a flood. The water level is high, reaching their ankles. One person is pouring water out of a container.]

Listening Strategy
Listen carefully for clues to help you identify the context of the listening:
- who is speaking.
- where and when they are speaking.
- what the situation is.

2 [2.05] Read the Listening Strategy. Then listen to three dialogues and answer questions 1-3 below for each one. Give reasons for your answers.
1 Who is speaking?
2 When are they speaking?
3 Where are they?

3 [2.06] Listen and match each dialogue with a photo of a natural disaster (A-D).
1 ___ 2 ___ 3 ___ 4 ___

4 [2.06] Listen again and circle the correct option (a-c).
1 The interview is taking place
   a in the man's house.
   b in the street outside the man's house.
   c in a church hall.
2 The speaker
   a works for a charity.
   b is a politician.
   c raises funds for a charity.
3 The people who started the fire
   a did it intentionally.
   b were cooking.
   c left without phoning the fire service.
4 The volcanic eruption
   a happened last year.
   b has just finished.
   c is still happening now.

5 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Write a dialogue between a journalist and a witness to a natural disaster (real or imaginary). Include some of this information. Act out your dialogue to the class.
1 Where was the witness? (at home, in the street, in a car)
2 What did they see and do? (helped children / old people, found family members, ran away, phoned the emergency services)
3 How did they feel? (terrified, upset, shocked, worried, helpless)
4 Was anyone injured? (people died / were injured / were taken to hospital, doctors helped people)

[The page includes four images labeled A, B, C, and D showing different natural disasters: a drought-stricken landscape, earthquake damage, a forest fire, and a volcanic eruption.]
