Unit 7 Tourism

4 Read the Reading Strategy. Then look at questions 1-4 in exercise 5. Find the underlined words in the text and explain why those options are not correct.

Reading Strategy
Do not assume that because a multiple-choice option contains words from the text, it is correct. Focus on meaning, not on individual words.
Treat each option as a true or false task in order to find the option that is true.

5 Circle the correct option (a-c).
1 Hilary loved her holiday because
a she drank a lot of coffee.
b she made a new friend.
c she learned some Spanish.

2 Kevin first saw the baby turtles
a in a conservation centre.
b near the diving centre.
c in their natural habitat.

3 On his holiday, Kevin
a bought some suncream.
b caught lots of fish.
c learned a new skill.

4 Terry got lost in the jungle because
a the guide walked too quickly.
b he chased a monkey.
c he dropped his sunglasses.

Last summer, I went to Nam Cat Tien in south Viet Nam with my aunt, uncle and cousins. My aunt loves adventure holidays. We stayed on a campsite in the jungle, and the local guide took us to see local wildlife. On the first day, I saw a wild boar and a monkey, which ran away with my sunglasses. I tried chasing it to get them back. I got separated from the group, and didn't know where they were. I was terrified! Finally, I heard the guide calling me. I wasn't lost for long, but it felt like ages!

6 SPEAKING Work in groups. Read the definition of an "ecotourist". Then discuss why holiday A is called an eco-holiday and in what ways the other holidays are good / bad for the environment. Give reasons.

Ecotourists travel in a way that shows respect to nature and does not damage it. They also try to learn about the local people, so they can help to improve their quality of life.

7 VOCABULARY Form holiday-related compound nouns by matching the words below with words 1-8. All of the compounds are in the texts.
