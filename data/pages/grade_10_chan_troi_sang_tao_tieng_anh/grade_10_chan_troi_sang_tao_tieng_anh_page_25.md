## Past continuous

I can use the past continuous.

1 Read the opening paragraph of a story.
Why does the narrator notice the tall man?

[An image of a crowded train platform with people walking and standing]

With my backpack in my hands, I stepped off the train onto the crowded platform. It was 7.30 in the evening. People were hurrying home. A mother and her two young children were sitting on a bench. The mother was talking to the boy, but he wasn't looking at her. The girl was singing quietly and playing with a toy. Around them, travellers were shouting greetings, waving goodbye, carrying heavy bags or running to catch trains. A very tall man was standing completely still near the exit. Why was he wearing summer clothes in this weather? And why was he looking straight at me?
