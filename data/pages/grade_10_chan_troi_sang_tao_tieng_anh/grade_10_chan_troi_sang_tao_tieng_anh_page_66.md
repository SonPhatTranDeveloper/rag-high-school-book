A Back in 2012, Andrew Johnson planned to apply to a film school after graduation, rather than look for a job. But then his dad noticed an advertisement for a job with toy manufacturer Lego. Andrew, who was already a Lego fan, sent in an application. It included a video of himself making models. The company loved it and invited him to participate in an unusual interview. He had to compete against seven other finalists in a model-building test. Andrew won. As a result, he was employed at Legoland Discovery Centre in Illinois as a Master Model Builder. "Lego was just a hobby, but now I can do what I love and get paid for it," said Andrew happily in an interview.

B Some film providers like Netflix employ people to watch new films and TV series, then ask them to make a note of what type of film it is (horror, rom-com, etc.), what age group and type of person might like it. The film provider can then recommend it to their members. Joe Mason finished his degree in film studies about two years ago and didn't know what to do next. Then he read an article about film taggers. The job was so fantastic, and he wrote to Netflix. At first, they weren't interested, but when Joe told them he speaks fluent French, they gave him a job. He watches French films and TV programmes. "It's a great job because I can have flexible working hours," said he. The only problem with the job is that Joe can't choose what he wants to watch.
