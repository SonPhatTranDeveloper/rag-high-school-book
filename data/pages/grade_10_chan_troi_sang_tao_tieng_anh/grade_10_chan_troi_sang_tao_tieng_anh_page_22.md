Be happy!

There have been lots of surveys about teenagers and happiness and they all come to different conclusions. Some surveys say that most young people are happiest when they spend time with their family. Others say it's when they're with friends. Some teenagers think that getting good marks at school and passing exams make them happy, while others feel that it's having a boyfriend or girlfriend. The problem is that there isn't just one thing that makes everyone happy, and what made you happy last week might not make you happy next week! However, there are some things that can help improve your mood when you are feeling unhappy. Experts believe that exercise can make you a happier person because it releases chemicals in your brain that are related to a feeling of pleasure.

There's another surprising idea to help make you happier. Although you might think that eating chocolate is bad for you, it seems, according to some experts, to be good to eat chocolate when you're feeling sad. Of course it isn't healthy to eat too much, but chocolate releases chemicals in the same way that exercise does - and for some people it's easier and quicker than working out in the gym! It's also important to remember that you can't be happy all the time. You can be happy for brief moments and you should value these times. And when you feel sad, go for a run or eat some chocolate - you'll soon cheer up!
