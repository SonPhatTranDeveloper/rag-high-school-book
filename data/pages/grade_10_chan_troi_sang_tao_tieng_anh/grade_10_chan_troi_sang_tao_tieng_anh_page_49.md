Part 1
On a clear night, you can often see meteors – space rocks – as they fall towards the Earth. Each rock is smaller than an apple, but they look as bright as stars in the night sky, so people call them 'shooting stars'. Larger meteors are much rarer, but their effects are far more spectacular. In 2013, a meteor exploded in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia. The explosion was more powerful than the 1945 Hiroshima atomic bomb, but its effect was not as devastating as the bomb because the meteor exploded much further from the ground. Scientists compared the Chelyabinsk meteor to an earlier – and far bigger – explosion: the Tunguska Event.

Part 2
The Tunguska Event of 1908 was 1________ (far) from a city, so 2________ (few) people saw it, but it was much 3________ (powerful) than the one in Chelyabinsk. It destroyed more than 80 million trees in the Siberian forest, so it's lucky it was not 4________ (close) to a town or city. The night sky became 5________ (bright) than normal for a few days, and people a hundred kilometres away could read a newspaper outdoors even at midnight. Most scientists believe it was a meteor explosion, but there are some 6________ (unusual) theories too. Perhaps it was a UFO!
