### My first business

There are quite a lot of stories about young entrepreneurs these days – people who have started their own businesses while they are still at school and have gone on to make large amounts of money. ¹_____ I think I was about five years old when I decided to try to make some money. ²_____ I had seen it in a toy shop the month before, but my parents could not afford it because it was very expensive. So, I decided to save all of my pocket money until I had enough to buy it myself. ³_____ To get the doll more quickly, I came up with an idea. My mum grew some pretty flowers in her garden. I decided to take the flowers onto the street, held them out and said, 'Fifty pence a bunch,' to the people who passed by. One lady stopped and gave me fifty pence. ⁴_____ After half an hour I sold out all of the flowers and earned some money for my doll. I was really proud then.
