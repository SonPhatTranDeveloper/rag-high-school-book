4 Read the Writing Strategy. Then answer the questions.

### Writing Strategy
When you write a letter to a friend or relative:
• Start with: Dear [Jake],
• Begin the main part of the letter with a short introduction. You can use phrases like: How are you? Sorry I didn't reply sooner. Thanks for your letter.
• Write in paragraphs.
• Do not use very formal language in your letter.
• Use contractions (it's, there's, etc).
• Finish the main part of the letter with a short paragraph. You can use phrases like: That's all for now. I'd better go now. Write again soon.
• End the letter with Love, or Best wishes, and your first name.

1 What phrase(s) does Andy include in his introduction?
2 How many paragraphs does he write?
3 Does he use any very formal language?
4 What contractions does he use?
5 What phrase(s) does Andy include in the final paragraph?

5 Read the Learn this! box and complete it with the phrase Andy uses for making his invitation.

### LEARN THIS! Invitations
Would you like + infinitive?
Why don't you / we + infinitive without to?
How about + -ing form?
__________ + -ing form?

6 You are going to do the task in exercise 2. Plan your letter using the prompts below and your ideas. Write your letter using the plan.
1 Title of film, who you went with
2 Your opinion
3 Later activity
4 A suggestion to do something

### CHECK YOUR WORK
Have you...
• mentioned and developed each element of the task?
• followed the advice in the Writing Strategy?
• checked the spelling and grammar?

Dear Jake,

Thanks for your letter and sorry I didn't reply sooner.

I went to see a great film at the cinema last weekend - Iron Man 3.

I went with my friend Paddy because he loves the Iron Man films. It isn't a new film, but it was definitely worth seeing again. The special effects are amazing and it also has a clever plot with lots of twists. There are some funny lines in the script too.

After the film, we met some other friends at a noodle bar in town. It was fun, but I didn't really like the food. It was very spicy!

Do you fancy going to the cinema next week? They're having a season of action films, including all the Batman series. Let me know and I'll book the tickets!

Anyway, I'd better go now. Ring me and let me know about the cinema.

Love,
Andy
