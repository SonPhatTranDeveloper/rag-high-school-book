[Image description: Two circular images are shown. One depicts a person fishing from a boat with a fish jumping out of the water. The other shows a sinking fishing boat.]

A dream holiday turned into a nightmare for an American brother and sister, Dan and Kate Suski. During a fishing trip in the Caribbean, their boat sank.

The weather wasn't brilliant that day, but Dan had caught a huge fish! He was trying to pull it onto the boat when the captain realised water was coming into the cabin. The boat was sinking fast. The captain used his radio to send a message for help. Then he shouted, "Jump out!" 1__________ They were about 15 km from land.

The captain said that help was coming. The weather was now awful, but they were wearing life jackets. After an hour, the captain and the Suskis lost each other, and there was no sign of rescue. 2__________ They were both thinking the same terrifying thought: sharks!

A helicopter appeared, but nobody saw Dan and Kate in the water. Day turned to night and the Suskis swam for fourteen hours. Finally, they saw some cliffs; they were near land! 3__________ There were dangerous sharp rocks. By now, they were exhausted. Eventually, they reached a sandy beach. 4__________

Then they found a town and picked some green bananas. Finally, they met a young farm worker. 5__________ He also gave them some tragic news: the captain was lost at sea. After a few days in hospital Dan and Kate were fine. Their story had another happy ending: a rescue boat found the captain after 23 hours in the water!
