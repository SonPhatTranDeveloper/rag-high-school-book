Yesterday, sixteen-year-old Hector Turner began his attempt to become the youngest Briton to complete a 242 km "ultra-marathon" across the Sahara Desert. On the same day, Geordie Stewart, a twenty-year-old university student, set off for Everest. He wanted to be the youngest Briton to achieve the "Seven Summits" challenge – climbing the highest mountain on each continent. Last year, Mike Perham circumnavigated the world alone by boat at the age of seventeen.

Why do today's teenagers feel this need for exploration and adventure? Why do they want to have wild experiences? Mike Perham has a theory: "Kids dream more than adults."
