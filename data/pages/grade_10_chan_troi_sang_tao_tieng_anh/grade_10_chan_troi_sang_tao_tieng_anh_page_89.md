A taste of adventure

Where do you usually go on holiday? To the beach or the mountains? Have you ever tried an adventure holiday or even an ecotourism holiday?

A Hilary Bradt: aged 15
Last year, I went to Guatemala on an ecotourism holiday with my family. We stayed with a local family of coffee farmers. They showed us how to harvest coffee, carry it in a special backpack and roast it. I don't really like the taste of coffee, but I loved the smell when we roasted it. The best part was that I made friends with a girl on the farm and now we're penfriends. I'm even learning Spanish!

B Kevin Rushby: aged 16
For our last family holiday, we went to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. It was amazing. I saw loads of multicoloured fish and even learned how to dive. We also visited a turtle sanctuary, and helped to take baby turtles out to the beach, their natural habitat. Forgetting the suncream, I got really sunburned. It was worth it though, to see the baby turtles swimming away.
