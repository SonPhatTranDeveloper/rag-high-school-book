Writing Strategy
In an informal text, you can use common abbreviations like e.g. and etc. You should use short forms like I'm and don't, not full forms (I am and do not).

5 Read the Writing Strategy. Find these abbreviations in the invitations in exercise 3. What do they mean? Do you know any other common abbreviations?
a.m.  BBQ  p.m.  e.g.  etc.

6 Write an invitation (100-120 words) to a party that includes outdoor activities. Remember to include:
• the reason for the party (birthday, end of exams, etc.).
• the date, time and place of the party.
• any instructions (what the person should bring, wear, etc.).

7 Work in pairs. Swap your invitations from exercise 6. Then write a reply (100-120 words). In your reply, you should:
• thank your partner for the invitation.
• say why you cannot come to the party.
• suggest doing something another time.

CHECK YOUR WORK
Have you ...
• covered all the points in exercises 6 and 7?
• used short forms rather than full forms?
• used a phrase from exercise 4 in your reply?
• checked the spelling and grammar?

Hi Bess,
I'm having a party on the beach to celebrate the end of term. It's on Sunday 20 July and starts at 3 p.m.
In the afternoon, we're going to try two different water sports: jet-skiing and kite surfing. It's going to be a lot of fun!
In the evening, we're having a BBQ on the beach, with loads of food and music too. Please let me know if you can come.
Lisa
PS My dad is doing the BBQ, so you don't have to bring anything.

Dear Lisa,
Thank you so much for your invitation. It sounds like a great way to celebrate the start of the school holidays.
Unfortunately I can't make it because I'm going to be in France with my parents.
We get back on 27 July. It would be nice to meet up some time. Why don't we go to the cinema?
I hope you enjoy the party!
Bess
