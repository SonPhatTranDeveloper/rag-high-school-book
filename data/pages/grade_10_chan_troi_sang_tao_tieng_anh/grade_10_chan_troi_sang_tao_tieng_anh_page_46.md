Review Unit 3

Reading

Read the following passage and circle True (T), False (F) or Doesn't say (DS).

The Avengers

Superheroes are very popular: people love films like The Amazing Spider Man, Batman Begins, Thor and Captain America. They are all great, but in my opinion The Avengers is the best superhero film because it's different. Superheroes are usually lonely people – they save the world on their own. This isn't how things work in The Avengers.

Loki is the bad character in the film, and he's also Thor's brother. The film begins when Loki and his powerful army steal the Tesseract. This is a source of energy, and Loki can use it to destroy the Earth. Nick Fury is the good character, and he's also the leader of an organisation called S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick knows that he isn't strong enough to fight against Loki – so he creates a team of superheroes.

There are a lot of great characters in The Avengers. The final battle scene between the superhero team and Loki's army is the most exciting scene in the film. The script is very clever too, and there are some funny lines for all the characters.

The idea of putting superheroes together was amazing, and the audience loved it.
