> When I was about nine years old, I bought an enormous plastic spider from a joke shop. I couldn't wait to play a prank on my sister with it. One morning, I put it in the shower just before my big sister went into the bathroom. I waited outside the door. I heard a really loud scream and my sister ran out of the bathroom. I thought it was really funny, but she was really cross when she found out, and chased me round the house. I feel bad about it now, it took her ages to get over it because she was so shocked!

> Last February, I sent my brother a Valentine's card. In the card, I wrote 'Be my Valentine! With love from ???', and I tried to disguise my handwriting. When he opened it, he looked carefully at the writing, and I thought for a moment he realised it was from me. But there was a girl in his class who he liked, and he thought the card was from her. He seemed really pleased and he decided to ask her out, and now they're going out! Eventually, he found out she didn't send it. He immediately suspected me, so I owned up. He was a bit cross, but he forgave me because of the happy ending.
