Writing Strategy
When you write a formal letter / email:
• Start with: Dear (Mrs White), if you know the name of the person, or Dear Sir or Madam, if you do not.
• Include the topic of the email in the subject line.
• Write in paragraphs. One-sentence paragraphs are fine for opening or closing an application letter.
• Do not use colloquial language or short forms (I'm, there's, etc.).
• Finish with Yours sincerely, if you used the person's name at the start, or Yours faithfully, if you did not.

4 Read the Writing Strategy. Answer the questions.
1 What is the subject line in Grace's letter?
2 Does Grace include any one-sentence paragraphs?
3 How does Grace express these things in a more formal way?

Subject: Application for the role of starting-line steward

Dear Mr Bellis,

A I noticed your advertisement in the school canteen for a starting-line steward at the school charity run, and I am writing to apply for the role.

B I was planning to take part in the charity run, but I find it much more rewarding if I volunteer as part of the event. I am keen to help as a steward because I am very sociable and organised.

C I have experience of volunteering. Last year, I helped at the village fair. I was in charge of the paints and materials. I believe I possess all the necessary personal qualities for the role. I am positive, energetic and reliable.

D I am available for the charity run meeting after school next Monday. Moreover, my parents can take me to the event.

E I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,
Grace Browning
