[Text in a gray box]
Phu Quoc is a Vietnamese island in south Viet Nam. It has beautiful white beaches with lines of palm trees and modern hotel resorts that attract a lot of tourists. The island offers a peaceful atmosphere, fresh seafood and picturesque landscapes. In the past, the island was a quiet place, but in the past few years, the number of tourists has grown. In 2018, more than four million people visited the popular island to relax and swim in the clear blue sea. Many of the hotel resorts are luxurious and the visitors bring a lot of money to the local economy.

Behind the impressive swimming pools and restaurants, there is a national park. In fact, more than half of the island belongs to Phu Quoc National Park and contains mountains, tropical jungle and lots of interesting wildlife. This means that, although there are more and more tourists, nature is strictly protected.

The largest town is called Duong Dong, which is full of markets selling fish, local food and crafts. They are great places to buy local souvenirs to help you remember your holiday in paradise!
