### Hurricane in Jamaica

My aunt and uncle have lived in Jamaica all their lives so they know about hurricanes. I, however, was born in Britain because my parents came here when they got married. They always tell wonderful stories about Jamaica, and we love going to visit our aunt and uncle. Last year was the first time I went on my own, which meant the visit was even more exciting.

I went in December because between October and mid-December the weather isn't as hot, but it's still lovely. However, it's also the hurricane season during those months. Luckily, my aunt and uncle knew a hurricane was coming and, therefore, there was already lots of extra food and drink in the house.

As soon as we saw the first signs of the hurricane, we closed the windows and the doors, and then we waited. The storm was a Category 1 hurricane, with heavy rain and winds of about 125 km/h. I played games and chatted with my cousins to pass the time, and we ate lots of food. But I felt quite scared with the sound of the wind crashing around the house, day and night. My aunt told me there was nothing to worry about and that they'd had worse storms than that, so I felt a bit better. We heard radio reports of flooding on the roads and on farms, and some damage to buildings. The storm began on Monday, and then luckily by Wednesday it was moving out to sea.
