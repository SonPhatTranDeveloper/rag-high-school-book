Buried treasure

In November 2013, James Howells started searching an enormous rubbish dump. He was looking for a computer hard drive which he had thrown away three months earlier. The hard drive contained 7,500 bitcoins (a virtual currency that people use online). He had bought the bitcoins for almost nothing in 2009, but by 2013 the value of a single bitcoin had risen to over $1,000. So, the value of Howells's collection had increased to $7.5 million.

In 2010, Howells, who works in IT, took his computer apart because he had spilled a drink on it. He had first kept the hard drive and had sold the other parts. When in 2013 he heard about the value of the virtual currency, it was too late. He had thrown the hard drive away! He had totally forgotten about the bitcoins. Howells never found the hard drive â€“ and unfortunately, he hadn't saved any of his data.
