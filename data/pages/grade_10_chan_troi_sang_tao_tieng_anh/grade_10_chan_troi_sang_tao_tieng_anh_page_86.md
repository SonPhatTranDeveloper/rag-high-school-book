# 7C Listening

## Check your ticket!

I can understand and use emphatic stress.

1 **SPEAKING** Work in pairs. Describe the photo. Where are the people? What are they doing? What do you think they are saying?

2 **3.05** Read and listen to the dialogue. When, where and how did Lydia go on holiday in the summer?

**Tom:** Did you go to Spain in July?  
**Lydia:** No, we went to Portugal. And we went in August.  
**Tom:** Where did you fly to?  
**Lydia:** We drove there, actually.

### Listening Strategy

Notice the way that speakers emphasise certain words to stress an alternative or to correct what someone has said:

"Would you like a *double* room or a *single* room?"  
"A *double* room, please."  

"Does the plane arrive at *nine*?" "No, it arrives at *five*."  

"Dave's in *Paris*." "No, he isn't. He's in *Rome*."  

3 **3.05** **PRONUNCIATION** Practise the examples in the Listening Strategy. Underline the stressed words in the dialogue in exercise 2. Listen again and check.

4 **3.06** Listen to the sentences. Pay attention to the words that are stressed. Circle the sentence in each pair (a or b) which the speaker is replying to.

1 No, he flew to *Italy* last summer.  
   a Did Sam fly to France last summer?  
   b Did Sam fly to Italy last spring?

2 I'd like a *black* coffee, please.  
   a Would you like a drink?  
   b Would you like white coffee or black coffee?

3 No, we're meeting at *three fifty*.  
   a Are we meeting at three fifteen?  
   b Are we meeting at two fifty?

4 I haven't got a *credit card*.  
   a You can buy the tickets by credit card.  
   b Why didn't you buy the tickets online?

5 I'll have a *ham* sandwich, please.  
   a What kind of sandwich would you like?  
   b Would you like something to eat?

5 Look at the photos. Which place would you prefer to go for a holiday? Why?

6 **3.07** Listen to a true story about a holiday that went wrong. What was the misunderstanding between Georgina and the travel agent?

7 **3.07** Listen again. Are the sentences true or false? Write T or F.

1 The woman next to Georgina was the first to mention Spain.
2 Georgina booked the holiday by phone.
3 She discovered her mistake just after the plane took off.
4 The flight attendant was kind and helpful.
5 The travel agent has given her a free holiday in Australia.
