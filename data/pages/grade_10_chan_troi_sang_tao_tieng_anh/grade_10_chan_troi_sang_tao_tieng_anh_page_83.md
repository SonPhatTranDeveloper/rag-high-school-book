Vocabulary strategy
When you record new vocabulary in your mind maps, use visuals to make it more memorable. For example, cut out images from magazines and stick them in your mind map. Play some vocabulary games like word bingo or charades. Sing songs that contain the new vocabulary. Doing these activities regularly will make it easier to remember new words.
