## Could playing video games be good for your health?

Many people assume that video games have a negative effect on young people. A lot of time in front of a screen is bad for the mind and the body, and combat games cause concern because they contain violence. Newspapers often express the same opinion. However, according to a report in American Psychologist, playing video games can be good for children's education, health and social skills.

Video games can actually improve certain mental skills. Combat games, for example, teach players to think in three dimensions. This helps children with science, technology, engineering and maths.

Other types of video game can have other positive effects. In 2013, research showed that children who play role-playing games get better grades at school than those who don't play them. Other research showed that playing any video game improves children's creativity.

Quick and simple games like Angry Birds can improve players' mood and prevent them from feeling anxious. The report also says that video games teach children how to react well to failure because players continually fail and try again. This makes them emotionally strong in real life.

Video games can improve social skills too, the report says. More than 70% of gamers play with a friend, and many take part in online games, like Farmville, with millions of other people. The players learn how to lead a group, work together and make decisions. Overall, the report accepts that some video games can have negative effects, but reminds us that they can have benefits too.
