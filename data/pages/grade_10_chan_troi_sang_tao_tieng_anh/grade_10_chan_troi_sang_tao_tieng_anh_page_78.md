# Aaron Levie

loves tinned spaghetti. He lives in a small apartment. At the age of 27, his biggest luxury is his smartphone. However, as co-founder and CEO of Box, a successful IT company, he is worth about $100 million. He loves his job and works hard. Most days, he does not leave the office until after midnight.

Levie and his friend Dylan Smith started Box in 2005 while still at university. It offered a better way of storing data, cloud storage.

Like most new businesses, Box did not bring in much income at the start. When it began, Levie and Smith looked for funding, but couldn't find any investors. For that reason, nobody wanted to risk lending them money. Eventually, a well-known entrepreneur called Mark Cuban agreed to put money into Box. Soon, Box grew quickly and had contracts with many of the biggest companies in the USA.

Now, Box has grown a lot and so have its profits, making Levie a multi-millionaire. But Levie says that it doesn't interest him. "I'm certainly not into money." Otherwise, he has lunch meetings in burger bars. "And I still like tinned spaghetti. I'd be happy if I had it every day."
