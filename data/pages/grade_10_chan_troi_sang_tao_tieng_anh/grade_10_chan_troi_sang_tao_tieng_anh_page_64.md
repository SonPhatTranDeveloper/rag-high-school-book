Is university education overvalued?
Eighteen-year-old American, Andrew Brackin, has received $100,000 to go and live in San Francisco and develop his own business. He plans to create a website that helps charities to raise money. The money comes from Peter Thiel, co-creator of PayPal. Every year, Thiel selects 20 students with the best business ideas. Andrew got to the final where he had to present his ideas to important business people from Silicon Valley. Thiel is an ex-student himself and he has strong views on university education. He feels that many young people overestimate the benefits of university education and undervalue the benefits of working in business. They apply for degree and postgraduate courses without thinking about how it will help them.

Benefits of going to university
There are several benefits of going to university that you should think about before making a decision about your future.

Prospects
If you have a university degree, you will generally be offered higher paid jobs. Furthermore, graduates have the option to fast-track their career with multiple graduate study schemes.

Lifelong friends
You can meet people from different backgrounds and visit other countries. If you like sports, many universities have teams where you can play at all different levels, even semi-professional.

Independence
University offers the opportunity to live away from home for the first time. You can learn how to manage your time and not oversleep.

3 Read the Learn this! box. Then read the texts in exercise 2 again and find words with five of the prefixes in the table.

### LEARN THIS! Prefixes
Prefixes change the meaning of nouns, adjectives and verbs. Sometimes a hyphen is used with a prefix and sometimes it is not (e.g. semi-final, semicolon). You may need to check in a dictionary.

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| co- | with | co-operate |
| ex- | former | ex-wife |
| micro- | extremely small | microchip |
| multi- | many | multicoloured |
| over- | too much | overcooked |
| post- | after | post-war |
| re- | again | rewrite |
| semi- | half | semicircle |
| under- | too little | undercooked |

4 2.19 PRONUNCIATION Listen to the examples in the table and mark the stress. Practise saying the words.

Study strategy
To help remember new vocabulary:
• visualise its meaning
• restate or explain it in your own words
• create a non-linguistic representation of it (a picture or symbolic representation)
• classify it and write synonyms, antonyms, etc.
• share and compare new words with a partner

5 USE OF ENGLISH Rewrite the sentences, replacing the underlined words with a word starting with the prefix in brackets.
1 I work as a pilot with Elaine (co-). I am Elaine's co-pilot.
2 Mick slept for too long and missed his bus. (over-)
3 Please write the sentence again. (re-)
4 We live in a society with lots of people of different cultures. (multi-)
5 Sam doesn't get much money for the job he does. (under-)

6 SPEAKING Work in pairs. Ask and answer the questions. Give extra information where you can.
1 Which jobs do you think are overpaid? (Why?)
2 Are you good at multi-tasking? (Give an example.)
