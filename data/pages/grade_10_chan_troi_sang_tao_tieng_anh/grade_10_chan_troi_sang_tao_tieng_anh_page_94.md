Living cheaply in New Zealand
I've been in New Zealand for six months, and, as far as I'm concerned, it's the adventure capital of the world! Hiking, skydiving, caving, ... the list goes on. And it doesn't have to cost a lot to live here. When I arrived, I stayed in a hostel in Auckland. It was cheap, and I met lots of people. I joined up with a few of them and we started touring the country - buses are the cheapest way to get about. We stayed in affordable campsites in the most amazing places. Right now, I'm back in a hostel in Wellington. I'm taking a city break before I start touring again.
