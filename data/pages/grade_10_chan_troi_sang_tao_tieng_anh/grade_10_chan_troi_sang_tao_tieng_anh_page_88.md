## Compounds

I can understand and use a range of compounds related to travel.

### Can I see your ticket, please?

I went on my first flight last week, it was so exciting! And, in the end, quite funny. Mum and dad have travelled a lot and said it would be nice and relaxing. We collected our boarding passes at the check-in desk, and mum checked our gate number on the departure screen. Then we left our bags at the bag drop. At the security checks, we put our passports in the trays with our hand luggage. While we were waiting in the departure lounge, mum realised she'd left her passport at the security check. She jumped up and ran back in a complete panic. Then dad said they were calling our flight number. He called mum to tell her to meet us at departure gate 5, after passport control. Mum came back holding her passport in the air and we queued up to board. The flight attendant checking our tickets was confused. 'Erm, sorry, this isn't your flight.' She showed dad our tickets, and he realised the flight number was different! We all had to run to another gate and got there just as they were closing it. Next time I think I'll be in charge!
