will, be going to and the first conditional

I can make predictions, plans, offers and promises, and talk about future situations and their consequences.

1 ðŸ”Š2:15 Look at the photo. How do you think the girl is feeling? Then read and listen to the dialogue.

Toby: Hi, Mia. Are you OK? You look a bit anxious.
Mia: I've got a job interview in twenty minutes.
Toby: Oh! I won't chat, then, I promise!
Mia: It's OK. I'm going to leave soon anyway. I need to walk to Hill Top Road. Is it far?
Toby: Not really. It'll take about ten minutes.
Mia: Oh no. Look at that rain! I'm going to get wet!
Toby: I'll lend you my umbrella.
Mia: It's OK. I'll call a taxi.
Toby: There isn't time for that. Here, take it.
Mia: Thanks. I'll give it back later. Where will you be?
Toby: I'll wait here for you. Good luck!

2 Read the Learn this! box. Then find all the examples of will and be going to in the dialogue in exercise 1.

## LEARN THIS! will and be going to

a For predictions, we use:
1 be going to based on what we can see or hear.
   Look at those clouds! There's going to be a storm.
2 will based on what we know or is just a guess.
   I (don't) think the weather will be warmer next month.

b For plans, we use:
1 be going to when we have already decided what to do.
   I'm going to stay in tonight. I've got the DVD ready!
2 will when we are deciding what to do as we speak.
   Somebody's at the door. I'll see who it is.

c For offers and promises, we use will.
   I'll phone you later. I won't forget.

3 Match each example of will and be going to in the dialogue with a rule in the Learn this! box.

4 SPEAKING: Work in groups. Talk about your plans and predictions of the future. Use will and be going to.

I'll probably work in a cafÃ© some time in the future.

5 Describe the photo. What is the job of the man on the right? Use the words below to help you.
button floor lift operate (v) open (v) press (v)

6 Read the text and check your answer to exercise 5. What other jobs do you think might disappear in the future?

A hundred years ago, every lift had an operator who stopped the lift at the different floors, and opened and closed the doors. That job no longer exists because lifts are now automatic. Which jobs that people do today will disappear because of technology? Most people book their holidays online. If this trend continues, travel agents will probably become unnecessary. Self-service check-outs at supermarkets are becoming very common, and so are automatic toll booths on motorways. Many people now read the news online. If newspapers disappear entirely, we won't need newsagents. And what will happen if everyone learns online instead of in a classroom? Teachers might disappear!

7 Look at the highlighted first conditional sentence in the text in exercise 6, and read the Learn this! box below. Complete rule a with present simple and will + verb. Then find two more examples in the text.

## LEARN THIS! The first conditional

a We use the first conditional to predict the result of an action. We use the __________ to describe the action, and __________ to describe the result.
If I get the job, I'll have to move to New York.

b The if clause can come before or after the main clause. If it comes after, we don't use a comma.
I won't take the job if it isn't challenging enough.

8 SPEAKING: Work in pairs. Ask and answer the questions.
What will you do if ...
1 you lose your mobile phone?
2 it rains all day on Saturday?
3 you get good marks in your final exams?
