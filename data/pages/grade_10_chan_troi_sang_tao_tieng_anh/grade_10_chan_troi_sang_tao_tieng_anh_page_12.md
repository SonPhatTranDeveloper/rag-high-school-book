### RECYCLE! Present continuous
We use the present continuous for things happening as we speak.
Grace is making dinner (at this moment).
However, with verbs not used in continuous tenses (believe, belong, hate, know, seem, etc.), we use the present simple even for things happening now.
Look! Jack seems cross (at this moment).

8 1.06 Read the Recycle! box. Then listen again and complete the sentences (a-d) with speakers 1-4 and the correct present tense form of the verbs in brackets.

a Speaker _______ _______ (not know) that a friend's exam result is bad.
b Speaker _______ _______ (not understand) why there aren't any buses.
c Speaker _______ _______ (have) a ticket for a really good concert.
d Speaker _______ _______ (make) a birthday cake for a friend who won't like it.
