## Verb + preposition

I can understand and use verb + preposition collocations.

1 Would you like to travel to another planet? Why? / Why not?

2 Read the text. Do you think it is a good idea to colonise the moon and/or Mars? Give reasons for your answer.

MARS ONE

NASA is planning to send people back to the moon and Mars. This will be the Artemis program. The idea of living on the moon clearly appeals to a lot of people. Teams of scientists from several countries, including India, China and Israel, are working hard to take part in the race. Films like Ad Astra, starring Brad Pitt, show us people on scheduled flights to the moon showing their ID on arrival almost as if they were arriving at an airport on Earth. Indeed, many people believe that people will set up home on the moon soon. So, if that is true, how will the settlers adjust to the conditions on the moon? How will they deal with problems like lack of oxygen, zero gravity and extreme temperatures? Robotic rovers have already searched for water on the moon, but have found none in liquid form. However, they have discovered some ice below the surface.

NASA's plan is to work with private companies to establish a base on the moon around 2028. Then, part of their job will be to prepare for the future exploration of Mars. Will some of us have the opportunity to travel into space and maybe even settle on Mars? Nobody knows for sure. But if we believe what we see in films like Passengers and Ad Astra, future generations may enjoy a very different life!
