### Lost in Australia

When eighteen-year-old student Sam Woodhead left college, he decided to have a gap year and go travelling before joining the army. Sam was already a fit long-distance runner, but he thought backpacking in Australia was great training for his future.

Sam arrived in Central Queensland and found a job on a cattle farm in the middle of the countryside. One Tuesday morning, soon after his arrival, he decided to go for a run. But Sam made some mistakes. He took a heavy backpack but only one bottle of water, and he didn't plan a route. After only two hours, he finished his water and realised he was lost. The temperature was close to 40°C, and he was soon exhausted. After four or five hours, he decided to stop and spend the night in the outback.

The next morning, Sam didn't report for work. His employers checked his room. His backpack and running shoes were gone, but his mobile and wallet were there. They called the rescue services and Sam's family. The rescue services sent helicopters to the area to try to find Sam, but there were a lot of trees so it was difficult for the pilots to see a person on the ground.
