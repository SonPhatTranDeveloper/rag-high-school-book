1.2 Spelling: 3rd person singular (he / she / it)
We add -s to the end of most verbs.
+ -s: start → starts   play → plays

We add -es if the verb ends in -ch, -ss, -sh or -o.
+ -es: teach → teaches   miss → misses
       do → does         go → goes

If the verb ends in a consonant + y, we change -y to -i
and add -es.
-y → -ies: study → studies   carry → carries

The 3rd person singular form of have is has.

Present continuous

1.3 We form the present continuous with the present simple
form of be and an -ing form:

Affirmative | Negative | Questions
I'm playing. | I'm not playing. | Am I playing?
                                  Yes, I am. / No, I'm not.
You're playing. | You aren't | Are you playing?
                 playing. | Yes, you are. / No, you aren't.
He's / She's / | He / She / It | Is he / she / it playing?
It's playing. | isn't playing. | Yes, he is. / No, she isn't.
We're / You're / | We / You / They | Are we / you / they playing?
They're playing. | aren't playing. | Yes, we are. / No, you aren't.

1.4    To form the -ing form, we add -ing to the end of most
verbs.
+ -ing: work → working   study → studying

With most verbs ending in -e, we drop the -e and add -ing.
-e → -ing: dance → dancing   write → writing

But if the verb ends in -ee, we simply add -ing.
+ -ing: agree → agreeing   see → seeing

And if the verb ends in -ie, we change the -ie to -y and add -ing.
-ie → -ying: die → dying   lie → lying

If the verb ends in a short accented vowel + a consonant, we
double the consonant and add -ing.
drop → dropping   plan → planning   chat → chatting
