2. Read the text. Who replied to Zoe's message? When did they reply, and from where?

### Message in a bottle

In 1990, Zoe Lemon was on a ferry, sailing from Hull in England to Germany. She was going on holiday with her family. The journey was long and tiring and ten-year-old Zoe soon got bored. To pass the time, she decided to write a message in a bottle and drop it into the sea. 'It will be interesting if someone finds it,' she thought. Then she forgot about the bottle completely.

Twenty-three years later, she was amazed to get a reply from someone in the Netherlands. A man was walking on the beach and was surprised to find Zoe's bottle in the sand. He wrote to the address on the message, where Zoe's parents still live. Zoe was delighted, but it was also very moving for her to see her message again after twenty-three years, and she cried when she read it. 'It's astonishing that the bottle didn't break,' said Zoe. Her five-year-old son thinks it is all very exciting and wants to put a message in a bottle himself!
