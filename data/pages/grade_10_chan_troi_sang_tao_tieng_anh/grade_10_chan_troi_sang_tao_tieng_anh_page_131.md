Top Presentation Tips

1 Plan your presentation
Plan carefully what you want to say. It can help to write a list:
• Your main points
• Examples
• Key phrases

2 Structure the beginning of your talk
Make your introduction clear so that your audience knows what you are going to talk about.

Good morning.
In this presentation I'm going to talk about
my favourite sport, sailing, and why you
should try it too. I will talk about my own
experiences of being out on the water, and
how it has changed my life for the better.

3 Learn key phrases
Think of some key phrases that you can use in your presentation. Learn the correct pronunciation and learn them off by heart. Don't learn your whole presentation because you won't sound natural when you speak. But if you know the key phrases, you'll sound and feel confident.

4 Watch a TED presentation
There are so many fantastic TED talks. Choose one, watch it and make notes about what you liked and didn't like about it. If you can watch several talks, even better. Then you can practise the things you like in your own presentation. You can also be aware of the things you don't like, so you don't do them in your presentation.

5 Practise presenting in different places
Practise in your bedroom, in the kitchen, in the park, at school. It's good to practise when there are distractions. It will help you improve your own focus.
If you can give your presentation in different places, you'll feel much more comfortable when it comes to the moment of the real presentation.

6 Body language and speech
Although you might be feeling nervous as you start your presentation, try using confident body language. Put your chest out, chin up and smile. When you do this, you'll feel more confident yourself.
Always remember to take deep breaths before speaking and pause while you're speaking. If you rush, your audience won't understand you.

7 Ending your talk
Be prepared to answer questions at the end of your talk. You can say:
Does anyone have any questions? or
I'm happy to answer any questions.
And finally, don't forget to thank people for listening.
Thank you all for listening.
