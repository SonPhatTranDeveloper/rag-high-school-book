## VIRTUAL MUSEUMS

Virtual museums went back to the 1950s, when early experiments of virtual reality were carried out, one typical example being the "Sensorama" machines developed by an American inventor. In 1992, the Apple Computer Inc. released The Virtual Computer, a CD-ROM which displays some 3D-modelled scientific exhibits in an environment similar to a museum. The Virtual Computer has been considered the first digital virtual museum covering themes such as medicine, plant growth and space. Another well-known example was the "Guggenheim Virtual Museum" by Asymptote Architecture in 1999. When the internet gained popularity and became more widespread in the 1990s, online virtual museums came into existence, including the Museum of Computer Art (USA) founded in 1993 and the WebMuseum, initially named WebLouvre, which was launched in 1994.

Most physical museums now offer virtual tours. These virtual museums provided endless education and entertainment opportunities to people around the world during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.
