## GLOBAL WARMING FACT FILE

• The Earth is heating up. The average 1__________ temperature is 0.75°C higher now than it was 100 years ago.
• When we burn 2__________ fuels, they give off 3__________ gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). This causes 4__________ warming.
• We have cut down over 50% of the Earth's 5__________ forests in the last 50 years. These are important because they remove CO2 from the atmosphere and add oxygen. They are also home to over half of the world's plant and animal species.
• Some scientists believe that by 2050, about 33% of all plant and animal species could die out because of 6__________ change.
• 7__________ levels are rising and the polar 8__________ caps are melting.
• Scientists say that fossil fuels like coal and gas may run out by the year 3000. So we need to develop alternatives, such as 9__________ energy and nuclear energy.

## LEARN THIS! Phrasal verbs
a Some phrasal verbs have a meaning which is similar to the meaning of the main verb (e.g. to use up = to use all of something).
b Other phrasal verbs have a meaning which is completely different from the meaning of the main verb (e.g. to carry on = to continue).

We are using up fossil fuels like coal and gas very fast. If we carry on like this for much longer, we will have no fuel left and it will be impossible to stop climate change. We must change the way we live and start looking after the environment. Politicians must wake up and take action! We can't put it off!

It's impossible to come up with a solution that everyone is happy with. We can't just close down all the coal and gas power stations. We rely on fossil fuels for most of our energy. And it's difficult to persuade people to change the way they live. How many people will give up their cars? Not many! We should just learn to live with climate change, not try to stop it.
