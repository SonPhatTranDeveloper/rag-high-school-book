The passive (present perfect, future, and modal verbs)
I can use different forms of the passive.

1 Look at the photo. What things do you think a wearable gadget can do?

2 Read the text and check your ideas from exercise 1.

[Image description: A close-up photograph of a person wearing a device that appears to be a camera or smart glasses attached to the side of their face, near their eye.]

The camera revolution

Over the past 20 years, the way in which we take, keep and share photos has been transformed. Most people use smartphones and digital cameras to take photos, and billions of photos have been uploaded to social networking sites. So have traditional cameras been replaced by these gadgets? Not yet, but it won't be long.

However, things are going to change again. Wearable gadgets that have recently been developed allow you to take a photo simply by blinking. Messages can also be sent and information can be accessed with these wearable gadgets. The technology hasn't been perfected, so these devices won't be sold in shops for a while.

Will cameras and mobiles be replaced by wearable gadgets? They can't be replaced yet but they may be taken over sooner than we think. What's certain is that our lives will be changed by these devices in ways we haven't thought of.
