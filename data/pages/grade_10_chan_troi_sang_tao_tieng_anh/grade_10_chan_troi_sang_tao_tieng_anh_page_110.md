Past simple (affirmative)

1.1 The affirmative form of the past simple is the same for all persons, singular and plural (I, you, he, we, etc.).
I watched a football match last night.
She watched TV. They watched a DVD.

1.2 Spelling: past simple (affirmative) form of regular verbs
We form the past simple (affirmative) form of regular verbs by adding -ed.
+ -ed: work → worked    play → played

If the verb ends in -e, we add -d.
+ -d: dance → danced    die → died

If the verb ends in a consonant + -y, we change -y to -i and add -ed.
-y → -ied: study → studied    cry → cried

If the verb ends in a short accented vowel + a consonant, we double the consonant and add -ed.
-p → -pped: drop → dropped
-n → -nned: plan → planned
-t → -tted: chat → chatted

1.3 Some verbs have irregular past simple (affirmative) forms. There are no spelling rules for these forms; you need to learn them by heart. See the list in the Workbook.

1.4 Past simple affirmative of be
The verb be has two past simple affirmative forms: was and were.

we           
you          were

1.5 We use the past simple:
• for a completed action or event at a definite point in the past.

• for actions or events that happened one after another.

Past simple (negative and interrogative)

I didn't watch.            Did I watch?

We / You / They didn't watch. Did we / you / they watch?
