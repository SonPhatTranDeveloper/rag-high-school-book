### Ann Davison

Margaret Ann Longstaffe was born *in / on* 5 June 1914 in Surrey, England. As a child, she really loved adventures. When she grew up, she travelled a lot. She liked riding horses, driving fast cars and flying aeroplanes. Ann became one of the very *few / little* women pilots in Britain in the 1930s.

In 1947 Ann and her husband, Frank Davison, also a pilot, bought an old boat "Reliance" and decided to *go / set* sail to travel the world. However, they were caught in *rough / hard* weather in the Irish Sea. The ship was wrecked and Frank was killed. Ann survived, washed *offshore / ashore* at the foot of a cliff.

> Later...
> After recovering from the tragedy, Ann worked as a successful writer and waited for a chance to sail again. She became even more determined to complete the challenge of a lifetime. She bought a small boat "Felicity Ann" (FA) and spent two years preparing it and teaching herself to sail. On 18 May 1952, she departed from Plymouth. She was still relatively inexperienced, but she made up for lack of experience with bravery.
> With her strength of character, Ann and 'FA' got through days of severe storms and loneliness. Ann Davison finally reached land in Dominica on 23 January 1953, becoming the first woman to sail solo across the Atlantic.
