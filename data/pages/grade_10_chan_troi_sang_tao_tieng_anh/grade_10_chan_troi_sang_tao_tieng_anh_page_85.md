[Postcard image with the following text:]
Dear Jenny,
We've been in Hue for three days. What an amazing city! The weather has been wonderful, and we've been to a lot of tourist attractions. I've visited the Tomb of Khai Dinh and I've even gone boating on the Perfume River. I've bought you a souvenir. Have you missed me?
Love, Ella
P.S. I had a text from Dylan. He's passed his driving test!

1 Read the postcard. Can you identify the country?

LEARN THIS! Present perfect
We use the present perfect:
a to give news, when we do not say exactly when the event happened. Guess what? I've won a competition!
b to talk about events during a period of time (e.g. a holiday) that is still continuing. I'm in Paris. I've visited a museum but I haven't seen the Eiffel Tower.
c to ask how long a situation has existed. How long have you been in Spain?
d with for or since to say how long a situation has existed. We use for with a period of time and since to say when it started. We've been in Spain for a week / since Tuesday.
