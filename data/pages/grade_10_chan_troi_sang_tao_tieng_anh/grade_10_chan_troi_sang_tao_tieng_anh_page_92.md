Hi, everyone! We arrived safely in Paris on Saturday evening. It was very windy and rainy, so the flight was a bit bumpy. Emma screamed when the plane landed! Hilarious, lol! The weather is much better now. Still cloudy, but it's stopped raining.

We've already been up the Eiffel Tower. We took the lift up, but walked back down the stairs. We've also walked down the Champs-Elysées. The shops there are really expensive, so I didn't buy anything!! Yesterday we went on a boat trip on the river Seine and then visited the Louvre art gallery. We saw the Mona Lisa, which was a bit disappointing. It's tiny!

Tomorrow we are going to visit Disneyland. It isn't far from here. Can't wait! Then on Friday we're going shopping (but not on the Champs-Elysées!) - I want to buy some souvenirs. Will post another entry tomorrow when we're back from Disneyland.

Sorry I haven't posted since Friday! Arrived in Tri An (Dong Nai Province) two days ago with Joanna after a tiring journey by coach from Ho Chi Minh City. There were roadworks on the motorway and an accident, so the journey took five hours instead of two. We're staying in a small inn. It's near a lake. The weather is sunny and dry and I can see a small wood from my window.

We've already been kayaking on the lake. The kayaking was fun and fantastic, but a bit scary! Tomorrow we're going biking. We're going to hire bikes from a shop near the inn. Really looking forward to it! Watch out for more blog entries in the next few days!

1. Look at the photos. Where would you prefer to go on holiday? Why?

2. Read the blog posts. Who has already done four things and has another two planned? Who has done one thing and has another one planned?

3. Read the task below. Do both blog posts include all four points?

You are on holiday with your family. Write a blog post. Include information about:
- the journey to your holiday destination and where you are staying.
- the weather.
- some holiday activities you have done.
- something you plan to do in the next few days.

### Writing Strategy
In informal style (e.g. in emails, blogs and postcards) we can omit sentence subjects I and we.

Must go now! Wish you were here!
With the present continuous, we can also omit the auxiliaries am and are:

Having a great time in Italy!

However, only do this once or twice in a text. Do not omit every instance of I and we.

4. Read the Writing Strategy. Find sentences where the writers have omitted the subject.

5. Rewrite the sentences, omitting the subject.
1. We have finally arrived!
2. I am looking forward to seeing you again.
3. I went up the Empire State Building yesterday.
4. We visited Ben Thanh Market on Friday.
5. We are flying back tomorrow.

6. VOCABULARY Complete the holiday activities below. They are all in the blog posts in exercise 2.
