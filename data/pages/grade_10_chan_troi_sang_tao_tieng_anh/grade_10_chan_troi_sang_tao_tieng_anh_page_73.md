Anne What do you mean? If money didn't exist, how would you buy things?
Nam If you needed something, you would make it. If you couldn't make it, you would swap with somebody else.
Anne So if I wanted a new mobile phone, how would I get it?
Nam You don't need things like that! I'm talking about essentials: food, clothes, that kind of thing. At the moment, millions of people haven't even got those.
Anne If money didn't exist, life wouldn't be better for poor people.
Nam No! I think it would. If nobody had any money, everybody would be equal.
