Global warming is probably the most serious threat we face, and we should all be worried about it. And indeed, it seems to me that most people take the issue very seriously. These days, people take a lot of care to recycle plastic, paper, glass and other materials. If recycling bins are available, they use them. What is more, they often choose to walk or cycle somewhere in order to reduce carbon emissions.

There are some people who believe that it is normal for the temperature of the Earth to go up and down. They don't believe that humans are causing global warming, so they don't believe that humans need to alter their behaviour. Other people may just be too selfish to lead a green lifestyle. Nevertheless, the majority of people believe the evidence and do whatever they can to combat climate change.

Writing Strategy
When you are expressing your opinions and the opinions of others, give your text a clear structure. For example:
• In one paragraph, give your opinion with two or three arguments that support it.
• In another paragraph, give the opposing view with one or two arguments supporting it. You can then say why you disagree with the opposing view (a counter-argument).
