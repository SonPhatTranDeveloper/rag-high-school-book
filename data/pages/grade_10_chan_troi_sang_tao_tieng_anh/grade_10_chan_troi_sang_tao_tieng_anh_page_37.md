Anno 2070 is a video game set in the year 2070. Many cities are now under the ocean. There aren't any countries or continents, but there are a lot of islands. Players have to build new cities. There are two main groups of characters: the Tycoons and the Ecos. As a player, you can choose to be in either group. Anno 2070 is not a combat game, but there are a few conflicts between the two groups and there are some important differences between them. The Tycoons build cities quickly and earn a lot of money, but their lifestyle causes a lot of pollution, and there are not many trees or plants on their islands. In contrast, the Ecos build "green" cities but their progress is slow. They don't use any coal or oil so there is not much pollution on their islands. The inhabitants eat healthy food and even have a little time for some hobbies, like listening to music. The aim of the game is to create your own world. How many cities can you build? How much energy do they all need? Can you grow any food? Can you complete any special missions? It depends on how well you play the game!
